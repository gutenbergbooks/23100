<h3>PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(1872)</p>

  <p>It is not without hesitation that I have taken upon myself the
  editorship of a work left avowedly imperfect by the author, and, from its
  miscellaneous and discursive character, difficult of completion with due
  regard to editorial limitations by a less able hand.</p>

  <p>Had the author lived to carry out his purpose he would have looked
  through his Budget again, amplifying and probably rearranging some of its
  contents. He had collected materials for further illustration of Paradox
  of the kind treated of in this book; and he meant to write a second part,
  in which the contradictions and inconsistencies of orthodox learning
  would have been subjected to the same scrutiny and castigation as
  heterodox ignorance had already received.</p>

  <p>It will be seen that the present volume contains more than the
  <i>Athenæum</i> Budget. Some of the additions formed a Supplement to the
  original articles. These supplementary paragraphs were, by the author,
  placed after those to which they respectively referred, being
  distinguished from the rest of the text by brackets. I have omitted these
  brackets as useless, except where they were needed to indicate subsequent
  writing.</p>

  <p>Another and a larger portion of the work consists of discussion of
  matters of contemporary interest, for the Budget was in some degree a
  receptacle for the author's thoughts on any literary, scientific, or
  social question. Having grown thus gradually to its present size, the
  book as it was left was not quite in a fit condition for publication, but
  the alterations which have been made are slight and few, being in most
  cases verbal, and such as the sense absolutely required, or
  transpositions of sentences to secure coherence with the rest, in places
  where the author, in his more recent insertion of them, had overlooked
  the connection in which they stood. In no case has the meaning been in
  any degree modified or interfered with.</p>

  <p>One rather large omission must be mentioned here. It is an account of
  the quarrel between Sir James South and Mr. Troughton on the mounting,
  etc. of the equatorial telescope at Campden Hill. At some future time
  when the affair has passed entirely out of the memory of living
  Astronomers, the appreciative sketch, which is omitted in this edition of
  the Budget, will be an interesting piece of history and study of
  character.<a name="NtA_1" href="#Nt_1"><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>

  <p>A very small portion of Mr. James Smith's circle-squaring has been
  left out, with a still smaller portion of Mr. De Morgan's answers to that
  Cyclometrical Paradoxer.</p>

  <p>In more than one place repetitions, which would have disappeared under
  the author's revision, have been allowed to remain, because they could
  not have been taken away without leaving a hiatus, not easy to fill up
  without damage to the author's meaning.</p>

  <p>I give these explanations in obedience to the rules laid down for the
  guidance of editors at page <a href="#page15">15</a>.<a name="NtA_2"
  href="#Nt_2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> If any apology for the fragmentary
  character of the book be thought necessary, it may be found in the
  author's own words at page 281 of the second volume.<a name="NtA_3"
  href="#Nt_3"><sup>[3]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The publication of the Budget could not have been delayed without
  lessening the interest attaching to the writer's thoughts upon questions
  of our own day. I trust that, incomplete as the work is compared with
  what it might have been, I shall not be held mistaken in giving it to the
  world. Rather let me hope that it will be welcomed as an old friend
  returning under great disadvantages, but bringing a pleasant remembrance
  of the amusement which its weekly appearance in the <i>Athenæum</i> gave
  to both writer and reader.</p>

  <p>The Paradoxes are dealt with in chronological order. This will be a
  guide to the reader, and with the alphabetical Index of Names, etc.,
  will, I trust, obviate all difficulty of reference.</p>

<h3>PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION.</h3>

  <p>If Mrs. De Morgan felt called upon to confess her hesitation at taking
  upon herself the labor of editing these Paradoxes, much more should one
  who was born two generations later, who lives in another land and who was
  reared amid different influences, confess to the same feeling when
  undertaking to revise this curious medley. But when we consider the
  nature of the work, the fact that its present rarity deprives so many
  readers of the enjoyment of its delicious satire, and the further fact
  that allusions that were commonplace a half century ago are now
  forgotten, it is evident that some one should take up the work and
  perform it <i>con amore</i>.</p>

  <p>Having long been an admirer of De Morgan, having continued his work in
  the bibliography of early arithmetics, and having worked in his library
  among the books of which he was so fond, it is possible that the present
  editor, whatever may be his other shortcomings, may undertake the labor
  with as much of sympathy as any one who is in a position to perform it.
  With this thought in mind, two definite rules were laid down at the
  beginning of the task: (1) That no alteration in the text should be made,
  save in slightly modernizing spelling and punctuation and in the case of
  manifest typographical errors; (2) That whenever a note appeared it
  should show at once its authorship, to the end that the material of the
  original edition might appear intact.</p>

  <p>In considering, however, the unbroken sequence of items that form the
  Budget, it seems clear that readers would be greatly aided if the various
  leading topics were separated in some convenient manner. After
  considerable thought it was decided to insert brief captions from time to
  time that might aid the eye in selecting the larger subjects of the text.
  In some parts of the work these could easily be taken from the original
  folio heads, but usually they had to be written anew. While, therefore,
  the present editor accepts the responsibility for the captions of the
  various subdivisions, he has endeavored to insert them in harmony with
  the original text.</p>

  <p>As to the footnotes, the first edition had only a few, some due to De
  Morgan himself and others to Mrs. De Morgan. In the present edition those
  due to the former are signed A. De M., and those due to Mrs. De Morgan
  appear with her initials, S.&nbsp;E. De M. For all other footnotes the present
  editor is responsible. In preparing them the effort has been made to
  elucidate the text by supplying such information as the casual reader
  might wish as he passes over the pages. Hundreds of names are referred to
  in the text that were more or less known in England half a century ago,
  but are now forgotten there and were never familiar elsewhere. Many books
  that were then current have now passed out of memory, and much that
  agitated England in De Morgan's prime seems now like ancient history.
  Even with respect to well-known names, a little information as to dates
  and publications will often be welcome, although the editor recognizes
  that it will quite as often be superfluous. In order, therefore, to
  derive the pleasure that should come from reading the Budget, the reader
  should have easy access to the information that the notes are intended to
  supply. That they furnish too much here and too little there is to be
  expected. They are a human product, and if they fail to serve their
  purpose in all respects it is hoped that this failure will not seriously
  interfere with the reader's pleasure.</p>

  <p>In general the present editor has refrained from expressing any
  opinions that would strike a discordant note in the reading of the text
  as De Morgan left it. The temptation is great to add to the discussion at
  various points, but it is a temptation to be resisted. To furnish such
  information as shall make the reading more pleasant, rather than to
  attempt to improve upon one of the most delicious bits of satire of the
  nineteenth century, has been the editor's wish. It would have been an
  agreeable task to review the history of circle squaring, of the
  trisection problem, and of the duplication of the cube. This, however,
  would be to go too far afield. For the benefit of those who wish to
  investigate the subject the editor can only refer to such works and
  articles as the following: F. Rudio, <i>Archimedes, Huygens, Lambert,
  Legendre,&mdash;mit einer Uebersicht über die Geschichte des Problemes
  von der Quadratur des Zirkels</i>, Leipsic, 1892; Thomas Muir, "Circle,"
  in the eleventh edition of the <i>Encyclopædia Britannica</i>; the
  various histories of mathematics; and to his own article on "The
  Incommensurability of <span class="grk">&pi;</span>" in Prof. J. W. A.
  Young's <i>Monographs on Topics of Modern Mathematics</i>, New York,
  1911.</p>

  <p>The editor wishes to express his appreciation and thanks to Dr. Paul
  Carus, editor of <i>The Monist</i> and <i>The Open Court</i> for the
  opportunity of undertaking this work; to James Earl Russell, LL.D., Dean
  of Teachers College, Columbia University, for his encouragement in its
  prosecution; to Miss Caroline Eustis Seely for her intelligent and
  painstaking assistance in securing material for the notes; and to Miss
  Lydia G. Robinson and Miss Anna A. Kugler for their aid and helpful
  suggestions in connection with the proof-sheets. Without the generous
  help of all five this work would have been impossible.</p>

<h2>A BUDGET OF PARADOXES</h2>

<p><!-- Page 1 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page1"></a>[1]</span></p>

<h3>INTRODUCTORY.</h3>

  <p>If I had before me a fly and an elephant, having never seen more than
  one such magnitude of either kind; and if the fly were to endeavor to
  persuade me that he was larger than the elephant, I might by possibility
  be placed in a difficulty. The apparently little creature might use such
  arguments about the effect of distance, and might appeal to such laws of
  sight and hearing as I, if unlearned in those things, might be unable
  wholly to reject. But if there were a thousand flies, all buzzing, to
  appearance, about the great creature; and, to a fly, declaring, each one
  for himself, that he was bigger than the quadruped; and all giving
  different and frequently contradictory reasons; and each one despising
  and opposing the reasons of the others&mdash;I should feel quite at my
  ease. I should certainly say, My little friends, the case of each one of
  you is destroyed by the rest. I intend to show flies in the swarm, with a
  few larger animals, for reasons to be given.</p>

  <p>In every age of the world there has been an established system, which
  has been opposed from time to time by isolated and dissentient reformers.
  The established system has sometimes fallen, slowly and gradually: it has
  either been upset by the rising influence of some one man, or it has been
  sapped by gradual change of opinion in the many.</p>

  <p>I have insisted on the isolated character of the dissentients, as an
  element of the <i>a priori</i> probabilities of the case. Show me a
  schism, especially a growing schism, and it is another thing. The
  homeopathists, for instance, shall be, if any one so think, as wrong as
  St. John Long; but an <!-- Page 2 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page2"></a>[2]</span>organized opposition, supported by the efforts
  of many acting in concert, appealing to common arguments and experience,
  with perpetual succession and a common seal, as the Queen says in the
  charter, is, be the merit of the schism what it may, a thing wholly
  different from the case of the isolated opponent in the mode of
  opposition to it which reason points out.</p>

  <p>During the last two centuries and a half, physical knowledge has been
  gradually made to rest upon a basis which it had not before. It has
  become <i>mathematical</i>. The question now is, not whether this or that
  hypothesis is better or worse to the pure thought, but whether it accords
  with observed phenomena in those consequences which can be shown
  necessarily to follow from it, if it be true. Even in those sciences
  which are not yet under the dominion of mathematics, and perhaps never
  will be, a working copy of the mathematical process has been made. This
  is not known to the followers of those sciences who are not themselves
  mathematicians and who very often exalt their horns against the
  mathematics in consequence. They might as well be squaring the circle,
  for any sense they show in this particular.</p>

  <p>A great many individuals, ever since the rise of the mathematical
  method, have, each for himself, attacked its direct and indirect
  consequences. I shall not here stop to point out how the very accuracy of
  exact science gives better aim than the preceding state of things could
  give. I shall call each of these persons a <i>paradoxer</i>, and his
  system a <i>paradox</i>. I use the word in the old sense: a paradox is
  something which is apart from general opinion, either in subject-matter,
  method, or conclusion.</p>

  <p>Many of the things brought forward would now be called
  <i>crotchets</i>, which is the nearest word we have to old
  <i>paradox</i>. But there is this difference, that by calling a thing a
  <i>crotchet</i> we mean to speak lightly of it; which was not the
  necessary sense of <i>paradox</i>. Thus in the sixteenth century many
  spoke of the earth's motion as the <i>paradox of <!-- Page 3 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page3"></a>[3]</span>Copernicus</i>, who held
  the ingenuity of that theory in very high esteem, and some, I think, who
  even inclined towards it. In the seventeenth century, the depravation of
  meaning took place, in England at least. Phillips says <i>paradox</i> is
  "a thing which seemeth strange"&mdash;here is the old meaning: after a
  colon he proceeds&mdash;"and absurd, and is contrary to common opinion,"
  which is an addition due to his own time.</p>

  <p>Some of my readers are hardly inclined to think that the word
  <i>paradox</i> could once have had no disparagement in its meaning; still
  less that persons could have applied it to themselves. I chance to have
  met with a case in point against them. It is Spinoza's <i>Philosophia
  Scripturæ Interpres, Exercitatio Paradoxa</i>, printed anonymously at
  Eleutheropolis, in 1666. This place was one of several cities in the
  clouds, to which the cuckoos resorted who were driven away by the other
  birds; that is, a feigned place of printing, adopted by those who would
  have caught it if orthodoxy could have caught them. Thus, in 1656, the
  works of Socinus could only be printed at Irenopolis. The author deserves
  his self-imposed title, as in the following:<a name="NtA_4"
  href="#Nt_4"><sup>[4]</sup></a></p>

  <p>"Quanto sane satius fuisset illam [Trinitatem] pro mysterio non
  habuisse, et Philosophiæ ope, antequam quod esset statuerent, secundum
  veræ logices præcepta quid esset cum Cl. Kleckermanno investigasse; tanto
  fervore ac labore in profundissimas speluncas et obscurissimos

  ille vir ... dogma illud, quamvis apud theologos eo nomine non multum
  gratiæ iniverit, ita ex immotis Philosophiæ fundamentis explicat ac
  demonstrat, ut paucis tantum immutatis, atque additis, nihil amplius
  animus veritate sincere deditus desiderare possit."</p>

  <p>This is properly paradox, though also heterodox. It supposes, contrary
  to all opinion, orthodox and heterodox, that philosophy can, with slight
  changes, explain the Athanasian doctrine so as to be at least compatible
  with orthodoxy. The author would stand almost alone, if not quite; and
  this is what he meant. I have met with the counter-paradox. I have heard
  it maintained that the doctrine as it stands, in all its mystery is <i>a
  priori</i> more likely than any other to have been Revelation, if such a
  thing were to be; and that it might almost have been predicted.</p>

  <p>After looking into books of paradoxes for more than thirty years, and
  holding conversation with many persons who have written them, and many
  who might have done so, there is one point on which my mind is fully made
  up. The manner in which a paradoxer will show himself, as to sense or
  nonsense, will not depend upon what he maintains, but upon whether he has
  or has not made a sufficient knowledge of what has been done by others,
  <i>especially as to the mode of doing it</i>, a preliminary to inventing
  knowledge for himself. That a little knowledge is a dangerous thing is
  one of the most fallacious of proverbs. A person of small knowledge is in
  danger of trying to make his <i>little</i> do the work of <i>more</i>;
  but a person without any is in more danger of making his <i>no</i>
  knowledge do the work of <i>some</i>. Take the speculations on the tides
  as an instance. Persons with nothing but a little geometry have certainly
  exposed themselves in their modes of objecting to results which require
  the higher mathematics to be known before an independent opinion can be
  formed on sufficient grounds. But persons with no geometry at all have
  done the same thing much more completely. <!-- Page 5 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page5"></a>[5]</span></p>

  <p>There is a line to be drawn which is constantly put aside in the
  arguments held by paradoxers in favor of their right to instruct the
  world. Most persons must, or at least will, like the lady in Cadogan
  Place,<a name="NtA_5" href="#Nt_5"><sup>[5]</sup></a> form and express an
  immense variety of opinions on an immense variety of subjects; and all
  persons must be their own guides in many things. So far all is well. But
  there are many who, in carrying the expression of their own opinions
  beyond the usual tone of private conversation, whether they go no further
  than attempts at oral proselytism, or whether they commit themselves to
  the press, do not reflect that they have ceased to stand upon the ground
  on which their process is defensible. Aspiring to lead <i>others</i>,
  they have never given themselves the fair chance of being first led by
  <i>other</i> others into something better than they can start for
  themselves; and that they should first do this is what both those classes
  of others have a fair right to expect. New knowledge, when to any
  purpose, must come by contemplation of old knowledge in every matter
  which concerns thought; mechanical contrivance sometimes, not very often,
  escapes this rule. All the men who are now called discoverers, in every
  matter ruled by thought, have been men versed in the minds of their
  predecessors, and learned in what had been before them. There is not one
  exception. I do not say that every man has made direct <span
  class="correction" title="text reads `acquantance'">acquaintance</span>
  with the whole of his mental ancestry; many have, as I may say, only
  known their grandfathers by the report of their fathers. But even on this
  point it is remarkable how many of the greatest names in all departments
  of knowledge have been real antiquaries in their several subjects.</p>

  <p>I may cite, among those who have wrought strongly upon opinion or
  practice in science, Aristotle, Plato, Ptolemy, Euclid, Archimedes, Roger
  Bacon, Copernicus, Francis Bacon, Ramus, Tycho Brahé, Galileo, Napier,
  Descartes, Leibnitz, Newton, Locke. I take none but names known out of
  their <!-- Page 6 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page6"></a>[6]</span>fields of work; and all were learned as well
  as sagacious. I have chosen my instances: if any one will undertake to
  show a person of little or no knowledge who has established himself in a
  great matter of pure thought, let him bring forward his man, and we shall
  see.</p>

  <p>This is the true way of putting off those who plague others with their
  great discoveries. The first demand made should be&mdash;Mr. Moses,
  before I allow you to lead me over the Red Sea, I must have you show that
  you are learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians upon your own subject.
  The plea that it is unlikely that this or that unknown person should
  succeed where Newton, etc. have failed, or should show Newton, etc. to be
  wrong, is utterly null and void. It was worthily versified by Sylvanus
  Morgan (the great herald who in his <i>Sphere of Gentry</i> gave coat
  armor to "Gentleman Jesus," as he said), who sang of Copernicus as
  follows (1652):</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"If Tellus winged be,</p>
      <p>The earth a motion round;</p>
      <p>Then much deceived are they</p>
      <p>Who nere before it found.</p>
      <p>Solomon was the wisest,</p>
      <p>His wit nere this attained;</p>
      <p>Cease, then, Copernicus,</p>
      <p>Thy hypothesis is vain."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Newton, etc. were once unknown; but they made themselves known by what
  they knew, and then brought forward what they could do; which I see is as
  good verse as that of Herald Sylvanus. The demand for previous knowledge
  disposes of twenty-nine cases out of thirty, and the thirtieth is worth
  listening to.</p>

  <p>I have not set down Copernicus, Galileo, etc. among the paradoxers,
  merely because everybody knows them; if my list were quite complete, they
  would have been in it. But the reader will find Gilbert, the great
  precursor of sound magnetical theory; and several others on whom no
  censure can be cast, though some of their paradoxes are inadmissible,
  <!-- Page 7 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page7"></a>[7]</span>some
  unprovoked, and some capital jokes, true or false: the author of
  <i>Vestiges of Creation</i> is an instance. I expect that my old
  correspondent, General Perronet Thompson, will admit that his geometry is
  part and parcel of my plan; and also that, if that plan embraced
  politics, he would claim a place for his <i>Catechism on the Corn
  Laws</i>, a work at one time paradoxical, but which had more to do with
  the abolition of the bread-tax than Sir Robert Peel.</p>

  <p>My intention in publishing this Budget in the <i>Athenæum</i> is <i>to
  enable those who have been puzzled by one or two discoverers to see how
  they look in a lump</i>. The only question is, has the selection been
  fairly made? To this my answer is, that no selection at all has been
  made. The books are, without exception, those which I have in my own
  library; and I have taken <i>all</i>&mdash;I mean all of the kind: Heaven
  forbid that I should be supposed to have no other books! But I may have
  been a collector, influenced in choice by bias? I answer that I never
  have collected books of this sort&mdash;that is, I have never searched
  for them, never made up my mind to look out for this book or that. I have
  bought what happened to come in my way at show or auction; I have
  retained what came in as part of the <i>undescribed</i> portion of
  miscellaneous auction lots; I have received a few from friends who found
  them among what they called their rubbish; and I have preserved books
  sent to me for review. In not a few instances the books have been bound
  up with others, unmentioned at the back; and for years I knew no more I
  had them than I knew I had Lord Macclesfield's speech on moving the
  change of Style, which, after I had searched shops, etc. for it in vain,
  I found had been reposing on my own shelves for many years, at the end of
  a summary of Leibnitz's philosophy. Consequently, I may positively affirm
  that the following list is formed by accident and circumstance alone, and
  that it truly represents the casualties of about a third of a century.
  For instance, the large proportion of works <!-- Page 8 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page8"></a>[8]</span>on the quadrature of the
  circle is not my doing: it is the natural share of this subject in the
  actual run of events.</p>

  <p>[I keep to my plan of inserting only such books as I possessed in
  1863, except by casual notice in aid of my remarks. I have found several
  books on my shelves which ought to have been inserted. These have their
  titles set out at the commencement of their articles, in leading
  paragraphs; the casuals are without this formality.<a name="NtA_6"
  href="#Nt_6"><sup>[6]</sup></a>]</p>

  <p>Before proceeding to open the Budget, I say something on my personal
  knowledge of the class of discoverers who square the circle, upset
  Newton, etc. I suspect I know more of the English class than any man in
  Britain. I never kept any reckoning; but I know that one year with
  another&mdash;and less of late years than in earlier time&mdash;I have
  talked to more than five in each year, giving more than a hundred and
  fifty specimens. Of this I am sure, that it is my own fault if they have
  not been a thousand. Nobody knows how they swarm, except those to whom
  they naturally resort. They are in all ranks and occupations, of all ages
  and characters. They are very earnest people, and their purpose is
  <i>bona fide</i> the dissemination of their paradoxes. A great
  many&mdash;the mass, indeed&mdash;are illiterate, and a great many waste
  their means, and are in or approaching penury. But I must say that never,
  in any one instance, has the quadrature of the circle, or the like, been
  made a pretext for begging; even to be asked to purchase a book is of the
  very rarest occurrence&mdash;it has happened, and that is all.</p>

  <p>These discoverers despise one another: if there were the concert among
  them which there is among foreign mendicants, a man who admitted one to a
  conference would be plagued to death. I once gave something to a very
  genteel French applicant, who overtook me in the street, at my own door,
  saying he had picked up my handkerchief: whether he picked it up in my
  pocket for an introduction, I know not. <!-- Page 9 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page9"></a>[9]</span>But that day week came
  another Frenchman to my house, and that day fortnight a French lady; both
  failed, and I had no more trouble. The same thing happened with Poles. It
  is not so with circle-squarers, etc.: they know nothing of each other.
  Some will read this list, and will say I am right enough, generally
  speaking, but that there <i>is</i> an exception, if I could but see
  it.</p>

  <p>I do not mean, by my confession of the manner in which I have sinned
  against the twenty-four hours, to hold myself out as accessible to
  personal explanation of new plans. Quite the contrary: I consider myself
  as having made my report, and being discharged from further attendance on
  the subject. I will not, from henceforward, talk to any squarer of the
  circle, trisector of the angle, duplicator of the cube, constructor of
  perpetual motion, subverter of gravitation, stagnator of the earth,
  builder of the universe, etc. I will receive any writings or books which
  require no answer, and read them when I please: I will certainly preserve
  them&mdash;this list may be enlarged at some future time.</p>

  <p>There are three subjects which I have hardly anything upon; astrology,
  mechanism, and the infallible way of winning at play. I have never cared
  to preserve astrology. The mechanists make models, and not books. The
  infallible winners&mdash;though I have seen a few&mdash;think their
  secret too valuable, and prefer <i>mutare quadrata rotundis</i>&mdash;to
  turn dice into coin&mdash;at the gaming-house: verily they have their
  reward.</p>

  <p>I shall now select, to the mystic number seven, instances of my
  personal knowledge of those who think they have discovered, in
  illustration of as many misconceptions.</p>

  <p>1. <i>Attempt by help of the old philosophy, the discoverer not being
  in possession of modern knowledge.</i> A poor schoolmaster, in rags,
  introduced himself to a scientific friend with whom I was talking, and
  announced that he had found out the composition of the sun. "How was that
  done?"&mdash;"By consideration of the four elements."&mdash;"What are
  <!-- Page 10 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page10"></a>[10]</span>they?"&mdash;"Of course, fire, air, earth,
  and water."&mdash;"Did you not know that air, earth, and water, have long
  been known to be no elements at all, but compounds?"&mdash;"What do you
  mean, sir? Who ever heard of such a thing?"</p>

  <p>2. <i>The notion that difficulties are enigmas, to be overcome in a
  moment by a lucky thought.</i> A nobleman of very high rank, now long
  dead, read an article by me on the quadrature, in an early number of the
  <i>Penny Magazine</i>. He had, I suppose, school recollections of
  geometry. He put pencil to paper, drew a circle, and constructed what
  seemed likely to answer, and, indeed, was&mdash;as he said&mdash;certain,
  if only this bit were equal to that; which of course it was not. He
  forwarded his diagram to the Secretary of the Diffusion Society, to be
  handed to the author of the article, in case the difficulty should happen
  to be therein overcome.</p>

  <p>3. <i>Discovery at all hazards, to get on in the world.</i> Thirty
  years ago, an officer of rank, just come from foreign service, and trying
  for a decoration from the Crown, found that his claims were of doubtful
  amount, and was told by a friend that so and so, who had got the order,
  had the additional claim of scientific distinction. Now this officer,
  while abroad, had bethought himself one day, that there really could be
  no difficulty in finding the circumference of a circle: if a circle were
  rolled upon a straight line until the undermost point came undermost
  again, there would be the straight line equal to the circle. He came to
  me, saying that he did not feel equal to the statement of his claim in
  this respect, but that if some clever fellow would put the thing in a
  proper light, he thought his affair might be managed. I was clever enough
  to put the thing in a proper light to himself, to this extent at least,
  that, though perhaps they were wrong, the advisers of the Crown would
  never put the letters K.C.B. to such a circle as his.</p>

  <p>4. <i>The notion that mathematicians cannot find the circle for common
  purposes.</i> A working man measured the altitude of a cylinder
  accurately, and&mdash;I think the process of <!-- Page 11 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page11"></a>[11]</span>Archimedes was one of his
  proceedings&mdash;found its bulk. He then calculated the ratio of the
  circumference to the diameter, and found it answered very well on other
  modes of trial. His result was about 3.14. He came to London, and
  somebody sent him to me. Like many others of his pursuit, he seemed to
  have turned the whole force of his mind upon one of his points, on which
  alone he would be open to refutation. He had read some of Kater's
  experiments, and had got the Act of 1825 on weights and measures. Say
  what I would, he had for a long time but one answer&mdash;"Sir! I go upon
  Captain Kater and the Act of Parliament." But I fixed him at last. I
  happened to have on the table a proof-sheet of the <i>Astronomical
  Memoirs</i>, in which were a large number of observed places of the
  planets compared with prediction, and asked him whether it could be
  possible that persons who did not know the circle better than he had
  found it could make the calculations, of which I gave him a notion, so
  accurately? He was perfectly astonished, and took the titles of some
  books which he said he would read.</p>

  <p>5. <i>Application for the reward from abroad.</i> Many years ago,
  about twenty-eight, I think, a Jesuit came from South America, with a
  quadrature, and a cutting from a newspaper announcing that a reward was
  ready for the discovery in England. On this evidence he came over. After
  satisfying him that nothing had ever been offered here, I discussed his
  quadrature, which was of no use. I succeeded better when I told him of
  Richard White, also a Jesuit, and author of a quadrature published before
  1648, under the name of <i>Chrysæspis</i>, of which I can give no
  account, having never seen it. This White (<i>Albius</i>) is the only
  quadrator who was ever convinced of his error. My Jesuit was struck by
  the instance, and promised to read more geometry&mdash;he was no
  Clavius&mdash;before he published his book. He relapsed, however, for I
  saw his book advertised in a few days. I may say, as sufficient proof of
  my being no collector, that I had not the curiosity to buy his book; and
  my friend the <!-- Page 12 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page12"></a>[12]</span>Jesuit did not send me a copy, which he
  ought to have done, after the hour I had given him.</p>

  <p>6. <i>Application for the reward at home.</i> An agricultural laborer
  squared the circle, and brought the proceeds to London. He left his
  papers with me, one of which was the copy of a letter to the Lord
  Chancellor, desiring his Lordship to hand over forthwith 100,000 pounds,
  the amount of the alleged offer of reward. He did not go quite so far as
  M. de Vausenville, who, I think in 1778, brought an action against the
  Academy of Sciences to recover a reward to which he held himself
  entitled. I returned the papers, with a note, stating that he had not the
  knowledge requisite to see in what the problem consisted. I got for
  answer a letter in which I was told that a person who could not see that
  he had done the thing should "change his business, and appropriate his
  time and attention to a Sunday-school, to learn what he could, and keep
  the <i>litle</i> children from <i>durting</i> their <i>close</i>." I also
  received a letter from a friend of the quadrator, informing me that I
  knew his friend had succeeded, and had been heard to say so. These
  letters were printed&mdash;without the names of the writers&mdash;for the
  amusement of the readers of <i>Notes and Queries</i>, First Series, xii.
  57, and they will appear again in the sequel.</p>

  <p>[There are many who have such a deep respect for any attempt at
  thought that they are shocked at ridicule even of those who have made
  themselves conspicuous by pretending to lead the world in matters which
  they have not studied. Among my anonyms is a gentleman who is angry at my
  treatment of the "poor but thoughtful" man who is described in my
  introduction as recommending me to go to a Sunday-school because I
  informed him that he did not know in what the difficulty of quadrature
  consisted. My impugner quite forgets that this man's "thoughtfulness"
  chiefly consisted in his demanding a hundred thousand pounds from the
  Lord Chancellor for his discovery; and I may add, that his greatest
  stretch of invention was finding out that "the clergy" <!-- Page 13
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page13"></a>[13]</span>were the means
  of his modest request being unnoticed. I mention this letter because it
  affords occasion to note a very common error, namely, that men unread in
  their subjects have, by natural wisdom, been great benefactors of
  mankind. My critic says, "Shakspeare, whom the Pro<sup>r</sup>
  (<i>sic</i>) may admit to be a wisish man, though an object of contempt
  as to learning ..." Shakespeare an object of contempt as to learning!
  Though not myself a thoroughgoing Shakespearean&mdash;and adopting the
  first half of the opinion given by George III, "What! is there not sad
  stuff? only one must not say so"&mdash;I am strongly of opinion that he
  throws out the masonic signs of learning in almost every scene, to all
  who know what they are. And this over and above every kind of direct
  evidence. First, foremost, and enough, the evidence of Ben Jonson that he
  had "little Latin and less Greek"; then Shakespeare had as much Greek as
  Jonson would call <i>some</i>, even when he was depreciating. To have any
  Greek at all was in those days exceptional. In Shakespeare's youth St.
  Paul's and Merchant Taylor's schools were to have masters learned in good
  and clean Latin literature, <i>and also in Greek if such may be
  gotten</i>. When Jonson spoke as above, he intended to put Shakespeare
  low among the learned, but not out of their pale; and he spoke as a rival
  dramatist, who was proud of his own learned sock; and it may be a subject
  of inquiry how much Latin <i>he</i> would call <i>little</i>. If
  Shakespeare's learning on certain points be very much less visible than
  Jonson's, it is partly because Shakespeare's writings hold it in chemical
  combination, Jonson's in mechanical aggregation.]</p>

  <p>7. An elderly man came to me to show me how the universe was created.
  There was one molecule, which by vibration became&mdash;Heaven knows
  how!&mdash;the Sun. Further vibration produced Mercury, and so on. I
  suspect the nebular hypothesis had got into the poor man's head by
  reading, in some singular mixture with what it found there. Some
  modifications of vibration gave heat, electricity, etc. I <!-- Page 14
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page14"></a>[14]</span>listened until
  my informant ceased to vibrate&mdash;which is always the shortest
  way&mdash;and then said, "Our knowledge of elastic fluids is imperfect."
  "Sir!" said he, "I see you perceive the truth of what I have said, and I
  will reward your attention by telling you what I seldom disclose, never,
  except to those who can receive my theory&mdash;the little molecule whose
  vibrations have given rise to our solar system is the Logos of St. John's
  Gospel!" He went away to Dr. Lardner, who would not go into the solar
  system at all&mdash;the first molecule settled the question. So hard upon
  poor discoverers are men of science who are not antiquaries in their
  subject! On leaving, he said, "Sir, Mr. De Morgan received me in a very
  different way! he heard me attentively, and I left him perfectly
  satisfied of the truth of my system." I have had much reason to think
  that many discoverers, of all classes, believe they have convinced every
  one who is not peremptory to the verge of incivility.</p>

  <p>My list is given in chronological order. My readers will understand
  that my general expressions, where slighting or contemptuous, refer to
  the ignorant, who teach before they have learned. In every instance,
  those of whom I am able to speak with respect, whether as right or wrong,
  have sought knowledge in the subject they were to handle before they
  completed their speculations. I shall further illustrate this at the
  conclusion of my list.</p>

  <p>Before I begin the list, I give prominence to the following letter,
  addressed by me to the <i>Correspondent</i> of October 28, 1865. Some of
  my paradoxers attribute to me articles in this or that journal; and
  others may think&mdash;I know some do think&mdash;they know me as the
  writer of reviews of some of the very books noticed here. The following
  remarks will explain the way in which they may be right, and in which
  they may be wrong. <!-- Page 15 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page15"></a>[15]</span></p>

<hr class="short" >

<p class="cenhead">THE EDITORIAL SYSTEM.</p>

  <p>"Sir,&mdash;I have reason to think that many persons have a very
  inaccurate notion of the <i>Editorial System</i>. What I call by this
  name has grown up in the last <i>centenary</i>&mdash;a word I may use to
  signify the hundred years now ending, and to avoid the ambiguity of
  <i>century</i>. It cannot conveniently be explained by editors
  themselves, and <i>edited</i> journals generally do not like to say much
  about it. In <i>your</i> paper perhaps, in which editorial duties differ
  somewhat from those of ordinary journals, the common system may be freely
  spoken of.</p>

  <p>"When a reviewed author, as very often happens, writes to the editor
  of the reviewing journal to complain of what has been said of him, he
  frequently&mdash;even more often than not&mdash;complains of 'your
  reviewer.' He sometimes presumes that 'you' have, 'through inadvertence'
  in this instance, 'allowed some incompetent person to lower the character
  of your usually accurate pages.' Sometimes he talks of 'your scribe,'
  and, in extreme cases, even of 'your hack.' All this shows perfect
  ignorance of the journal system, except where it is done under the notion
  of letting the editor down easy. But the editor never accepts the
  mercy.</p>

  <p>"All that is in a journal, except what is marked as from a
  correspondent, either by the editor himself or by the correspondent's
  real or fictitious signature, is published entirely on editorial
  responsibility, as much as if the editor had written it himself. The
  editor, therefore, may claim, and does claim and exercise, unlimited
  right of omission, addition, and alteration. This is so well understood
  that the editor performs his last function on the last revise without the
  'contributor' knowing what is done. The word <i>contributor</i> is the
  proper one; it implies that he furnishes materials without stating what
  he furnishes or how much of it is accepted, or whether he be the only
  contributor. All this applies both to political and literary journals. No
  editor acknowledges <!-- Page 16 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page16"></a>[16]</span>the right of a contributor to withdraw an
  article, if he should find alterations in the proof sent to him for
  correction which would make him wish that the article should not appear.
  If the <i>demand</i> for suppression were made&mdash;I say nothing about
  what might be granted to <i>request</i>&mdash;the answer would be, 'It is
  not your article, but mine; I have all the responsibility; if it should
  contain a libel, I could not give you up, even at your own desire. You
  have furnished me with materials, on the known and common understanding
  that I was to use them at my discretion, and you have no right to impede
  my operations by making the appearance of the article depend on your
  approbation of my use of your materials.'</p>

  <p>"There is something to be said for this system, and something against
  it&mdash;I mean simply on its own merits. But the all-conquering argument
  in its favor is, that the only practicable alternative is the modern
  French plan of no articles without the signature of the writers. I need
  not discuss this plan; there is no collective party in favor of it. Some
  may think it is not the only alternative; they have not produced any
  intermediate proposal in which any dozen of persons have concurred. Many
  will say, Is not all this, though perfectly correct, well known to be
  matter of form? Is it not practically the course of events that an
  engaged contributor writes the article, and sends it to the editor, who
  admits it as written&mdash;substantially, at least? And is it not often
  very well known, by style and in other ways, who it was wrote the
  article? This system is matter of form just as much as loaded pistols are
  matter of form so long as the wearer is not assailed; but matter of form
  takes the form of matter in the pulling of a trigger, so soon as the need
  arises. Editors and contributors who can work together find each other
  out by elective affinity, so that the common run of events settles down
  into most articles appearing much as they are written. And there are two
  safety-valves; that is, when judicious persons come together. In the
  first place, the editor himself, when he has selected his contributor,
  feels that <!-- Page 17 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page17"></a>[17]</span>the contributor is likely to know his
  business better than an editor can teach him; in fact, it is on that
  principle that the selection is made. But he feels that he is more
  competent than the writer to judge questions of strength and of tone,
  especially when the general purpose of the journal is considered, of
  which the editor is the judge without appeal. An editor who meddles with
  substantive matter is likely to be wrong, even when he knows the subject;
  but one who prunes what he deems excess, is likely to be right, even when
  he does not know the subject. In the second place, a contributor knows
  that he is supplying an editor, and learns, without suppressing truth or
  suggesting falsehood, to make the tone of his communications suit the
  periodical in which they are to appear. Hence it very often arises that a
  reviewed author, who thinks he knows the name of his reviewer, and
  proclaims it with expressions of dissatisfaction, is only wrong in
  supposing that his critic has given all his mind. It has happened to
  myself more than once, to be announced as the author of articles which I
  could not have signed, because they did not go far enough to warrant my
  affixing my name to them as to a sufficient expression of my own
  opinion.</p>

  <p>"There are two other ways in which a reviewed author may be wrong
  about his critic. An editor frequently makes slight insertions or
  omissions&mdash;I mean slight in quantity of type&mdash;as he goes over
  the last proof; this he does in a comparative hurry, and it may chance
  that he does not know the full sting of his little alteration. The very
  bit which the writer of the book most complains of may not have been seen
  by the person who is called the writer of the article until after the
  appearance of the journal; nay, if he be one of those&mdash;few, I
  daresay&mdash;who do not read their own articles, may never have been
  seen by him at all. Possibly, the insertion or omission would not have
  been made if the editor could have had one minute's conversation with his
  contributor. Sometimes it actually contradicts something which is <!--
  Page 18 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page18"></a>[18]</span>allowed
  to remain in another part of the article; and sometimes, especially in
  the case of omission, it renders other parts of the article
  unintelligible. These are disadvantages of the system, and a judicious
  editor is not very free with his <i>unus et alter pannus</i>. Next,
  readers in general, when they see the pages of a journal with the
  articles so nicely fitting, and so many ending with the page or column,
  have very little notion of the cutting and carving which goes to the
  process. At the very last moment arises the necessity of some trimming of
  this kind; and the editor, who would gladly call the writer to counsel if
  he could, is obliged to strike out ten or twelve lines. He must do his
  best, but it may chance that the omission selected would take from the
  writer the power of owning the article. A few years ago, an able opponent
  of mine wrote to a journal some criticisms upon an article which he
  expressly attributed to me. I replied as if I were the writer, which, in
  a sense, I was. But if any one had required of me an unmodified 'Yes' or
  'No' to the question whether I wrote the article, I must, of two
  falsehoods, have chosen 'No': for certain omissions, dictated by the
  necessities of space and time, would have amounted, had my signature been
  affixed, to a silent surrender of points which, in my own character, I
  must have strongly insisted on, unless I had chosen to admit certain
  inferences against what I had previously published in my own name. I may
  here add that the forms of journalism obliged me in this case to remind
  my opponent that it could not be permitted to me, <i>in that journal</i>,
  either to acknowledge or deny the authorship of the articles. The
  cautions derived from the above remarks are particularly wanted with
  reference to the editorial comments upon letters of complaint. There is
  often no time to send these letters to the contributor, and even when
  this can be done, an editor is&mdash;and very properly&mdash;never of so
  editorial a mind as when he is revising the comments of a contributor
  upon an assailant of the article. He is then in a better position as to
  information, and a more <!-- Page 19 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page19"></a>[19]</span>critical position as to responsibility. Of
  course, an editor never meddles, except under notice, with the letter of
  a correspondent, whether of a complainant, of a casual informant, or of a
  contributor who sees reason to become a correspondent. Omissions must
  sometimes be made when a grievance is too highly spiced. It did once
  happen to me that a waggish editor made an insertion without notice in a
  letter signed by me with some fiction, which insertion contained the name
  of a friend of mine, with a satire which I did not believe, and should
  not have written if I had. To my strong rebuke, he replied&mdash;'I know
  it was very wrong; but human nature could not resist.' But this was the
  only occasion on which such a thing ever happened to me.</p>

  <p>"I daresay what I have written may give some of your readers to
  understand some of the <i>pericula et commoda</i> of modern journalism. I
  have known men of deep learning and science as ignorant of the prevailing
  system as any uneducated reader of a newspaper in a country town. I may
  perhaps induce some writers not to be too sure about this, that, or the
  other person. They may detect their reviewer, and they may be safe in
  attributing to him the general matter and tone of the article. But about
  one and another point, especially if it be a short and stinging point,
  they may very easily chance to be wrong. It has happened to myself, and
  within a few weeks to publication, to be wrong in two ways in reading a
  past article&mdash;to attribute to editorial insertion what was really my
  own, and to attribute to myself what was really editorial insertion."</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>What is a man to do who is asked whether he wrote an article? He may,
  of course, refuse to answer; which is regarded as an admission. He may
  say, as Swift did to Serjeant Bettesworth, "Sir, when I was a young man,
  a friend of mine advised me, whenever I was asked whether I had written a
  certain paper, to deny it; and I accordingly tell that I did <i>not</i>
  write it." He may say, as I often do, <!-- Page 20 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page20"></a>[20]</span>when charged with having
  invented a joke, story, or epigram, "I want all the credit I can get, and
  therefore I always acknowledge all that is attributed to me, truly or
  not; the story, etc. <i>is</i> mine." But for serious earnest, in the
  matter of imputed criticism, the answer may be, "The article was of my
  material, but the editor has not let it stand as I gave it; I cannot own
  it as a whole." He may then refuse to be particular as to the amount of
  the editor's interference. Of this there are two extreme cases. The
  editor may have expunged nothing but a qualifying adverb. Or he may have
  done as follows. We all remember the account of Adam which satirizes
  woman, but eulogizes her if every second and third line be transposed. As
  in:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Adam could find no solid peace</p>
      <p class="i2">When Eve was given him for a mate,</p>
      <p>Till he beheld a woman's face,</p>
      <p class="i2">Adam was in a happy state."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>If this had been the article, and a gallant editor had made the
  transpositions, the author could not with truth acknowledge. If the
  alteration were only an omitted adverb, or a few things of the sort, the
  author could not with truth deny. In all that comes between, every man
  must be his own casuist. I stared, when I was a boy, to hear grave
  persons approve of Sir Walter Scott's downright denial that he was the
  author of Waverley, in answer to the Prince Regent's downright question.
  If I remember rightly, Samuel Johnson would have approved of the same
  course.</p>

  <p>It is known that, whatever the law gives, it also gives all that is
  necessary to full possession; thus a man whose land is environed by land
  of others has a right of way over the land of these others. By analogy,
  it is argued that when a man has a right to his secret, he has a right to
  all that is necessary to keep it, and that is not unlawful. If, then, he
  can only keep his secret by denial, he has a right to denial. This I
  admit to be an answer against all men except the denier himself; if
  conscience and self-respect will allow <!-- Page 21 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page21"></a>[21]</span>it, no one can impeach
  it. But the question cannot be solved on a case. That question is, A lie,
  is it <i>malum in se</i>, without reference to meaning and circumstances?
  This is a question with two sides to it. Cases may be invented in which a
  lie is the only way of preventing a murder, or in which a lie may
  otherwise save a life. In these cases it is difficult to acquit, and
  almost impossible to blame; discretion introduced, the line becomes very
  hard to draw.</p>

  <p>I know but one work which has precisely&mdash;as at first
  appears&mdash;the character and object of my Budget. It is the <i>Review
  of the Works of the Royal Society of London</i>, by Sir John Hill, M.D.
  (1751 and 1780, 4to.). This man offended many: the Royal Society, by his
  work, the medical profession, by inventing and selling
  extra-pharmacop&oelig;ian doses; Garrick, by resenting the rejection of a
  play. So Garrick wrote:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"For physic and farces his equal there scarce is;</p>
      <p>His farces are physic; his physic a farce is."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>I have fired at the Royal Society and at the medical profession, but I
  have given a wide berth to the drama and its wits; so there is no epigram
  out against me, as yet. He was very able and very eccentric. Dr. Thomson
  (<i>Hist. Roy. Soc.</i>) says he has no humor, but Dr. Thomson was a man
  who never would have discovered humor.</p>

  <p>Mr. Weld (<i>Hist. Roy. Soc.</i>) backs Dr. Thomson, but with a
  remarkable addition. Having followed his predecessor in observing that
  the <i>Transactions</i> in Martin Folkes's time have an unusual
  proportion of trifling and puerile papers, he says that Hill's book is a
  poor attempt at humor, and glaringly exhibits the feelings of a
  disappointed man. It is probable, he adds, that the points told with some
  effect on the Society; for shortly after its publication the
  <i>Transactions</i> possess a much higher scientific value.</p>

  <p>I copy an account which I gave elsewhere.</p>

  <p>When the Royal Society was founded, the Fellows set <!-- Page 22
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page22"></a>[22]</span>to work to prove
  all things, that they might hold fast that which was good. They bent
  themselves to the question whether sprats were young herrings. They made
  a circle of the powder of a unicorn's horn, and set a spider in the
  middle of it; "but it immediately ran out." They tried several times, and
  the spider "once made some stay in the powder." They inquired into Kenelm
  Digby's sympathetic powder. "Magnetic cures being discoursed of, Sir
  Gilbert Talbot promised to communicate what he knew of sympathetical
  cures; and those members who had any of the powder of sympathy, were
  desired to bring some of it at the next meeting."</p>

  <p>June 21, 1661, certain gentlemen were appointed "curators of the
  proposal of tormenting a man with the sympathetic powder"; I cannot find
  any record of the result. And so they went on until the time of Sir John
  Hill's satire, in 1751. This once well-known work is, in my judgment, the
  greatest compliment the Royal Society ever received. It brought forward a
  number of what are now feeble and childish researches in the
  Philosophical Transactions. It showed that the inquirers had actually
  been inquiring; and that they did not pronounce decision about "natural
  <i>knowledge</i>" by help of "<i>natural</i> knowledge." But for this,
  Hill would neither have known what to assail, nor how. Matters are now
  entirely changed. The scientific bodies are far too well established to
  risk themselves. <i>Ibit qui zonam perdidit:</i></p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Let him take castles who has ne'er a groat."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>These great institutions are now without any collective purpose,
  except that of promoting individual energy; they print for their
  contributors, and guard themselves by a general declaration that they
  will not be answerable for the things they print. Of course they will not
  put forward anything for everybody; but a writer of a certain reputation,
  or matter of a certain look of plausibility and safety, <!-- Page 23
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page23"></a>[23]</span>will find
  admission. This is as it should be; the pasturer of flocks and herds and
  the hunters of wild beasts are two very different bodies, with very
  different policies. The scientific academies are what a spiritualist
  might call "publishing mediums," and <i>their</i> spirits fall
  occasionally into writing which looks as if minds in the higher state
  were not always impervious to nonsense.</p>

  <p>The following joke is attributed to Sir John Hill. I cannot honestly
  say I believe it; but it shows that his contemporaries did not believe he
  had no humor. Good stories are always in some sort of keeping with the
  characters on which they are fastened. Sir John Hill contrived a
  communication to the Royal Society from Portsmouth, to the effect that a
  sailor had broken his leg in a fall from the mast-head; that bandages and
  a plentiful application of tarwater had made him, in three days, able to
  use his leg as well as ever. While this communication was under grave
  discussion&mdash;it must be remembered that many then thought tarwater
  had extraordinary remedial properties&mdash;the joker contrived that a
  second letter should be delivered, which stated that the writer had
  forgotten, in his previous communication, to mention that the leg was a
  wooden leg! Horace Walpole told this story, I suppose for the first time;
  he is good authority for the fact of circulation, but for nothing
  more.</p>

  <p>Sir John Hill's book is droll and cutting satire. Dr. Maty, (Sec.
  Royal Society) wrote thus of it in the <i>Journal Britannique</i> (Feb.
  1751), of which he was editor:</p>

  <p>"Il est fâcheux que cet ingénieux Naturaliste, qui nous a déjà donné
  et qui nous prépare encore des ouvrages plus utiles, emploie à cette
  odieuse tâche une plume qu'il trempe dans le fiel et dans l'absinthe. Il
  est vrai que plusieurs de ses remarques sont fondées, et qu'à l'erreur
  qu'il indique, il joint en même tems la correction. Mais il n'est pas
  toujours équitable, et ne manque jamais d'insulter. Que peut <!-- Page 24
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page24"></a>[24]</span>après tout
  prouver son livre, si ce n'est que la quarante-cinquième partie d'un
  très-ample et très-utile Recueil n'est pas exempte d'erreurs? Devoit-il
  confondre avec des Ecrivains superficiels, dont la Liberté du Corps ne
  permet pas de restreindre la fertilité, cette foule de savans du Premier
  ordre, dont les Ecrits ont orné et ornent encore les Transactions? A-t-il
  oublié qu'on y a vu fréquemment les noms des Boyle, des Newton, des
  Halley, des De Moivres, des Hans Sloane, etc.? Et qu'on y trouve encore
  ceux des Ward, des Bradley, des Graham, des Ellicot, des Watson, et d'un
  Auteur que Mr. Hill préfère à tous les autres, je veux dire de Mr. Hill
  lui-même?"<a name="NtA_7" href="#Nt_7"><sup>[7]</sup></a></p>

  <p>This was the only answer; but it was no answer at all. Hill's object
  was to expose the absurdities; he therefore collected the absurdities. I
  feel sure that Hill was a benefactor of the Royal Society; and much more
  than he would have been if he had softened their errors and enhanced
  their praises. No reviewer will object to me that I have omitted Young,
  Laplace, etc. But then my book has a true title. Hill should not have
  called his a review of the "Works."</p>

  <p>It was charged against Sir John Hill that he had tried to become a
  Fellow of the Royal Society and had failed. This he denied, and
  challenged the production of the certificate which a candidate always
  sends in, and which is preserved. <!-- Page 25 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page25"></a>[25]</span>But perhaps he could not
  get so far as a certificate&mdash;that is, could not find any one to
  recommend him; he was a likely man to be in such a predicament. As I have
  myself run foul of the Society on some little points, I conceive it
  possible that I may fall under a like suspicion. Whether I could have
  been a Fellow, I cannot know; as the gentleman said who was asked if he
  could play the violin, I never tried. I have always had a high opinion of
  the Society upon its whole history. A person used to historical inquiry
  learns to look at wholes; the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge, the
  College of Physicians, etc. are taken in all their duration. But those
  who are not historians&mdash;I mean not possessed of the habit of
  history&mdash;hold a mass of opinions about current things which lead
  them into all kinds of confusion when they try to look back. Not to give
  an instance which will offend any set of existing men&mdash;this merely
  because I can do without it&mdash;let us take the country at large. Magna
  Charta for ever! glorious safeguard of our liberties! <i>Nullus liber
  homo capiatur aut imprisonetur ... aut aliquo modo destruatur, nisi per
  judicium parium</i> ....<a name="NtA_8" href="#Nt_8"><sup>[8]</sup></a>
  <i>Liber homo: frank home</i>; a capital thing for him&mdash;but how
  about the <i>villeins</i>? Oh, there are none <i>now</i>! But there were.
  Who cares for villains, or barbarians, or helots? And so England, and
  Athens, and Sparta, were free States; all the freemen in them were free.
  Long after Magna Charta, villains were sold with their "chattels and
  offspring," named in that order. Long after Magna Charta, it was law that
  "Le Seigniour poit rob, naufrer, et chastiser son villein a son volunt,
  salve que il ne poit luy maim."<a name="NtA_9"
  href="#Nt_9"><sup>[9]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The Royal Society was founded as a co-operative body, and co-operation
  was its purpose. The early charters, etc. do not contain a trace of the
  intention to create a <i>scientific distinction</i>, a kind of Legion of
  Honor. It is clear that the <!-- Page 26 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page26"></a>[26]</span>qualification was ability and willingness to
  do good work for the promotion of natural knowledge, no matter in how
  many persons, nor of what position in society. Charles II gave a smart
  rebuke for exclusiveness, as elsewhere mentioned. In time arose, almost
  of course, the idea of distinction attaching to the title; and when I
  first began to know the Society, it was in this state. Gentlemen of good
  social position were freely elected if they were really educated men; but
  the moment a claimant was announced as resting on his science, there was
  a disposition to inquire whether he was scientific enough. The maxim of
  the poet was adopted; and the Fellows were practically divided into
  <i>Drink-deeps</i> and <i>Taste-nots</i>.</p>

  <p>I was, in early life, much repelled by the tone taken by the Fellows
  of the Society with respect to their very mixed body. A man high in
  science&mdash;some thirty-seven years ago (about 1830)&mdash;gave me some
  encouragement, as he thought. "We shall have you a Fellow of the Royal
  Society in time," said he. Umph! thought I: for I had that day heard of
  some recent elections, the united science of which would not have
  demonstrated I. 1, nor explained the action of a pump. Truly an elevation
  to look up at! It came, further, to my knowledge that the Royal
  Society&mdash;if I might judge by the claims made by very influential
  Fellows&mdash;considered itself as entitled to the best of everything:
  second-best being left for the newer bodies. A secretary, in returning
  thanks for the Royal at an anniversary of the Astronomical, gave rather a
  lecture to the company on the positive duty of all present to send the
  very best to the old body, and the absolute right of the old body to
  expect it. An old friend of mine, on a similar occasion, stated as a fact
  that the thing was always done, as well as that it ought to be done.</p>

  <p>Of late years this pretension has been made by a President of the
  Society. In 1855, Lord Rosse presented a confidential memorandum to the
  Council on the expediency of enlarging their number. He says, "In a
  Council so small it <!-- Page 27 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page27"></a>[27]</span>is impossible to secure a satisfactory
  representation of the leading scientific Societies, and it is scarcely to
  be expected that, under such circumstances, they will continue to publish
  inferior papers while they send the best to our <i>Transactions</i>."</p>

  <p>And, again, with all the Societies represented on the Council, "even
  if every Science had its Society, and if they published everything,
  withholding their best papers [i.e., from the Royal Society], which they
  would not be likely to do, still there would remain to the Royal Society
  ...." Lord Rosse seems to imagine that the minor Societies themselves
  transfer their best papers to the Royal Society; that if, for instance,
  the Astronomical Society were to receive from A.B. a paper of unusual
  merit, the Society would transfer it to the Royal Society. This is quite
  wrong: any preference of the Royal to another Society is the work of the
  contributor himself. But it shows how well hafted is the Royal Society's
  claim, that a President should acquire the notion that it is acknowledged
  and acted upon by the other Societies, in their joint and corporate
  capacities. To the pretension thus made I never could give any sympathy.
  When I first heard Mr. Christie, Sec. R.&nbsp;S., set it forth at the
  anniversary dinner of the Astronomical Society, I remembered the Baron in
  Walter Scott:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Of Gilbert the Galliard a heriot he sought,</p>
      <p>Saying, Give thy best steed as a vassal ought."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>And I remembered the answer:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Lord and Earl though thou be, I trow</p>
      <p>I can rein Buck's-foot better than thou."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Fully conceding that the Royal Society is entitled to preeminent rank
  and all the respect due to age and services, I could not, nor can I now,
  see any more obligation in a contributor to send his best to that Society
  than he can make out to be due to himself. This pretension, in my mind,
  was hooked on, by my historical mode of viewing things already mentioned,
  to my knowledge of the fact that the Royal <!-- Page 28 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page28"></a>[28]</span>Society&mdash;the chief
  fault, perhaps, lying with its President, Sir Joseph Banks&mdash;had
  sternly set itself against the formation of other societies; the
  Geological and Astronomical, for instance, though it must be added that
  the chief rebels came out of the Society itself. And so a certain not
  very defined dislike was generated in my mind&mdash;an anti-aristocratic
  affair&mdash;to the body which seemed to me a little too uplifted. This
  would, I daresay, have worn off; but a more formidable objection arose.
  My views of physical science gradually arranged themselves into a form
  which would have rendered F.R.S., as attached to my name, a false
  representation symbol. The Royal Society is the great fortress of general
  physics: and in the philosophy of our day, as to general physics, there
  is something which makes the banner of the R.S. one under which I cannot
  march. Everybody who saw the three letters after my name would infer
  certain things as to my mode of thought which would not be true
  inference. It would take much space to explain this in full. I may
  hereafter, perhaps, write a budget of collected results of the <i>a
  priori philosophy</i>, the nibbling at the small end of omniscience, and
  the effect it has had on common life, from the family parlor to the
  jury-box, from the girls'-school to the vestry-meeting. There are in the
  Society those who would, were there no others, prevent my criticism, be
  its conclusions true or false, from having any basis; but they are in the
  minority.</p>

  <p>There is no objection to be made to the principles of philosophy in
  vogue at the Society, when they are stated as principles; but there is an
  omniscience in daily practice which the principles repudiate. In like
  manner, the most retaliatory Christians have a perfect form of round
  words about behavior to those who injure them; none of them are as candid
  as a little boy I knew, who, to his mother's admonition, You should love
  your enemies, answered&mdash;Catch me at it!</p>

  <p>Years ago, a change took place which would alone have <!-- Page 29
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page29"></a>[29]</span>put a sufficient
  difficulty in the way. The co-operative body got tired of getting funds
  from and lending name to persons who had little or no science, and wanted
  F.R.S. to be in every case a Fellow Really Scientific. Accordingly, the
  number of yearly elections was limited to fifteen recommended by the
  Council, unless the general body should choose to elect more; which it
  does not do. The election is now a competitive examination: it is no
  longer&mdash;Are you able and willing to promote natural knowledge; it
  is&mdash;Are you one of the upper fifteen of those who make such claim.
  In the list of candidates&mdash;a list rapidly growing in
  number&mdash;each year shows from thirty to forty of those whom Newton
  and Boyle would have gladly welcomed as fellow-laborers. And though the
  rejected of one year may be the accepted of the next&mdash;or of the next
  but one, or but two, if self-respect will permit the candidate to hang
  on&mdash;yet the time is clearly coming when many of those who ought to
  be welcomed will be excluded for life, or else shelved at last, when past
  work, with a scientific peerage. Coupled with this attempt to create a
  kind of order of knighthood is an absurdity so glaring that it should
  always be kept before the general eye. This distinction, this mark set by
  science upon successful investigation, is of necessity a
  class-distinction. Rowan Hamilton, one of the greatest names of our day
  in mathematical science, never could attach F.R.S. to his
  name&mdash;<i>he could not afford it</i>. There is a condition
  precedent&mdash;Four Red Sovereigns. It is four pounds a year,
  or&mdash;to those who have contributed to the Transactions&mdash;forty
  pounds down. This is as it should be: the Society must be supported. But
  it is not as it should be that a kind of title of honor should be forged,
  that a body should take upon itself to confer distinctions <i>for
  science</i>, when it is in the background&mdash;and kept there when the
  distinction is trumpeted&mdash;that the wearer is a man who can spare
  four pounds a year. I am well aware that in England a person who is not
  gifted either by nature or art, with this amount of money power, <!--
  Page 30 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page30"></a>[30]</span>is, with
  the mass, a very second-rate sort of Newton, whatever he may be in the
  field of investigation. Even men of science, so called, have this
  feeling. I know that the <i>scientific advisers</i> of the Admiralty,
  who, years ago, received 100 pounds a year each for his trouble, were
  sneered at by a wealthy pretender as "fellows to whom a hundred a year is
  an object." Dr. Thomas Young was one of them. To a bookish man&mdash;I
  mean a man who can manage to collect books&mdash;there is no tax. To
  myself, for example, 40 pounds worth of books deducted from my shelves,
  and the life-use of the Society's splendid library instead, would have
  been a capital exchange. But there may be, and are, men who want books,
  and cannot pay the Society's price. The Council would be very liberal in
  allowing books to be consulted. I have no doubt that if a known
  investigator were to call and ask to look at certain books, the
  Assistant-Secretary would forthwith seat him with the books before him,
  absence of F.R.S. not in any wise withstanding. But this is not like
  having the right to consult any book on any day, and to take it away, if
  farther wanted.</p>

  <p>So much for the Royal Society as concerns myself. I must add that
  there is not a spark of party feeling against those who wilfully remain
  outside. The better minds of course know better; and the smaller
  <i>savants</i> look complacently on the idea of an outer world which
  makes <i>élite</i> of them. I have done such a thing as serve on a
  committee of the Society, and report on a paper: they had the sense to
  ask, and I had the sense to see that none of my opinions were compromised
  by compliance. And I will be of any use which does not involve the status
  of <i>homo trium literarum</i>; as I have elsewhere explained, I would
  gladly be <i>Fautor Realis Scientiæ</i>, but I would not be taken for
  <i>Falsæ Rationis Sacerdos</i>.</p>

  <p>Nothing worse will ever happen to me than the smile which individuals
  bestow on a man who does not <i>groove</i>. Wisdom, like religion,
  belongs to majorities; who can <!-- Page 31 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page31"></a>[31]</span>wonder that it should be so thought, when it
  is so clearly pictured in the New Testament from one end to the
  other?</p>

  <p>The counterpart of <i>paradox</i>, the isolated opinion of one or of
  few, is the general opinion held by all the rest; and the counterpart of
  false and absurd paradox is what is called the "vulgar error," the
  <i>pseudodox</i>. There is one great work on this last subject, the
  <i>Pseudodoxia Epidemica</i> of Sir Thomas Browne, the famous author of
  the <i>Religio Medici</i>; it usually goes by the name of Browne "On
  Vulgar Errors" (1st ed. 1646; 6th, 1672). A careful analysis of this work
  would show that vulgar errors are frequently opposed by scientific
  errors; but good sense is always good sense, and Browne's book has a vast
  quantity of it.</p>

  <p>As an example of bad philosophy brought against bad observation. The
  Amphisbæna serpent was supposed to have two heads, one at each end;
  partly from its shape, partly because it runs backwards as well as
  forwards. On this Sir Thomas Browne makes the following remarks:</p>

  <p>"And were there any such species or natural kind of animal, it would
  be hard to make good those six positions of body which, according to the
  three dimensions, are ascribed unto every Animal; that is, <i>infra</i>,
  <i>supra</i>, <i>ante</i>, <i>retro</i>, <i>dextrosum</i>,
  <i>sinistrosum</i>: for if (as it is determined) that be the anterior and
  upper part wherein the senses are placed, and that the posterior and
  lower part which is opposite thereunto, there is no inferior or former
  part in this Animal; for the senses, being placed at both extreams, doth
  make both ends anterior, which is impossible; the terms being Relative,
  which mutually subsist, and are not without each other. And therefore
  this duplicity was ill contrived to place one head at both extreams, and
  had been more tolerable to have settled three or four at one. And
  therefore also Poets have been more reasonable than Philosophers, and
  <i>Geryon</i> or <i>Cerberus</i> less monstrous than <i>Amphisbæna</i>."
  <!-- Page 32 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page32"></a>[32]</span></p>

  <p>There may be paradox upon paradox: and there is a good instance in the
  eighth century in the case of Virgil, an Irishman, Bishop of Salzburg and
  afterwards Saint, and his quarrels with Boniface, an Englishman,
  Archbishop of Mentz, also afterwards Saint. All we know about the matter
  is, that there exists a letter of 748 from Pope Zachary, citing
  Virgil&mdash;then, it seems, at most a simple priest, though the Pope was
  not sure even of that&mdash;to Rome to answer the charge of maintaining
  that there is another world (<i>mundus</i>) under our earth
  (<i>terra</i>), with another sun and another moon. Nothing more is known:
  the letter contains threats in the event of the charge being true; and
  there history drops the matter. Since Virgil was afterwards a Bishop and
  a Saint, we may fairly conclude that he died in the full flower of his
  orthodox reputation. It has been supposed&mdash;and it seems
  probable&mdash;that Virgil maintained that the earth is peopled all the
  way round, so that under some spots there are antipodes; that his
  contemporaries, with very dim ideas about the roundness of the earth, and
  most of them with none at all, interpreted him as putting another earth
  under ours&mdash;turned the other way, probably, like the second piece of
  bread-and-butter in a sandwich, with a sun and moon of its own. In the
  eighth century this would infallibly have led to an underground Gospel,
  an underground Pope, and an underground Avignon for him to live in. When,
  in later times, the idea of inhabitants for the planets was started, it
  was immediately asked whether they had sinned, whether Jesus Christ died
  for <i>them</i>, whether their wine and their water could be lawfully
  used in the sacraments, etc.</p>

  <p>On so small a basis as the above has been constructed a companion case
  to the persecution of Galileo. On one side the positive assertion, with
  indignant comment, that Virgil was deposed for antipodal heresy, on the
  other, serious attempts at justification, palliation, or mystification.
  Some writers say that Virgil was found guilty; others that he gave
  satisfactory explanation, and became very good friends with <!-- Page 33
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page33"></a>[33]</span>Boniface: for
  all which see Bayle. Some have maintained that the antipodist was a
  different person from the canonized bishop: there is a second Virgil,
  made to order. When your shoes pinch, and will not stretch, always throw
  them away and get another pair: the same with your facts. Baronius was
  not up to the plan of a substitute: his commentator Pagi (probably
  writing about 1690) argues for it in a manner which I think Baronius
  would not have approved. This Virgil was perhaps a slippery fellow. The
  Pope says he hears that Virgil pretended licence from him to claim one of
  some new bishoprics: this he declares is totally false. It is part of the
  argument that such a man as this could not have been created a Bishop and
  a Saint: on this point there will be opinions and opinions.<a
  name="NtA_10" href="#Nt_10"><sup>[10]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Lactantius, four centuries before, had laughed at the antipodes in a
  manner which seems to be ridicule thrown on the idea of the earth's
  roundness. Ptolemy, without reference to the antipodes, describes the
  extent of the inhabited part of the globe in a way which shows that he
  could have had no objection to men turned opposite ways. Probably, in the
  eighth century, the roundness of the earth was matter of thought only to
  astronomers. It should always be remembered, especially by those who
  affirm persecution of a true opinion, that but for our knowing from
  Lactantius that the antipodal notion had been matter of assertion and
  denial among theologians, we could never have had any great confidence in
  Virgil really having maintained the simple theory of the existence of
  antipodes. And even now we are not entitled to affirm it as having
  historical proof: the evidence <!-- Page 34 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page34"></a>[34]</span>goes to Virgil having been charged with very
  absurd notions, which it seems more likely than not were the absurd
  constructions which ignorant contemporaries put upon sensible opinions of
  his.</p>

  <p>One curious part of this discussion is that neither side has allowed
  Pope Zachary to produce evidence to character. He shall have been an
  Urban, say the astronomers; an Urban he ought to have been, say the
  theologians. What sort of man was Zachary? He was eminently sensible and
  conciliatory; he contrived to make northern barbarians hear reason in a
  way which puts him high among that section of the early popes who had the
  knack of managing uneducated swordsmen. He kept the peace in Italy to an
  extent which historians mention with admiration. Even Bale, that
  Maharajah of pope-haters, allows himself to quote in favor of Zachary,
  that "multa Papalem dignitatem decentia, eademque præclara (scilicet)
  opera confecit."<a name="NtA_11" href="#Nt_11"><sup>[11]</sup></a> And
  this, though so willing to find fault that, speaking of Zachary putting a
  little geographical description of the earth on the portico of the
  Lateran Church, he insinuates that it was intended to affirm that the
  Pope was lord of the whole. Nor can he say how long Zachary held the see,
  except by announcing his death in 752, "cum decem annis pestilentiæ sedi
  præfuisset."<a name="NtA_12" href="#Nt_12"><sup>[12]</sup></a></p>

  <p>There was another quarrel between Virgil and Boniface which is an
  illustration. An ignorant priest had baptized "in nomine Patri<i>a</i>,
  et Fili<i>a</i> et Spiritu<i>a</i> Sanct<i>a</i>." Boniface declared the
  rite null and void: Virgil maintained the contrary; and Zachary decided
  in favor of Virgil, on the ground that the absurd form was only ignorance
  of Latin, and not heresy. It is hard to believe that this man deposed a
  priest for asserting the whole globe to be inhabited. To me the little
  information that we have seems <!-- Page 35 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page35"></a>[35]</span>to indicate&mdash;but not with
  certainty&mdash;that Virgil maintained the antipodes: that his ignorant
  contemporaries travestied his theory into that of an underground cosmos;
  that the Pope cited him to Rome to explain his system, which, as
  reported, looked like what all would then have affirmed to be heresy;
  that he gave satisfactory explanations, and was dismissed with honor. It
  may be that the educated Greek monk, Zachary, knew his Ptolemy well
  enough to guess what the asserted heretic would say; we have seen that he
  seems to have patronized geography. The <i>description</i> of the earth,
  according to historians, was a <i>map</i>; this Pope may have been more
  ready than another to prick up his ears at any rumor of geographical
  heresy, from hope of information. And Virgil, who may have entered the
  sacred presence as frightened as Jacquard, when Napoleon I sent for him
  and said, with a stern voice and threatening gesture, "You are the man
  who can tie a knot in a stretched string," may have departed as well
  pleased as Jacquard with the riband and pension which the interview was
  worth to him.</p>

  <p>A word more about Baronius. If he had been pope, as he would have been
  but for the opposition of the Spaniards, and if he had lived ten years
  longer than he did, and if Clavius, who would have been his astronomical
  adviser, had lived five years longer than he did, it is probable, nay
  almost certain, that the great exhibition, the proceeding against
  Galileo, would not have furnished a joke against theology in all time to
  come. For Baronius was sensible and witty enough to say that in the
  Scriptures the Holy Spirit intended to teach how to go to Heaven, not how
  Heaven goes; and Clavius, in his last years, confessed that the whole
  system of the heavens had broken down, and must be mended.</p>

  <p>The manner in which the Galileo case, a reality, and the Virgil case,
  a fiction, have been hawked against the Roman see are enough to show that
  the Pope and his adherents have not cared much about physical philosophy.
  In truth, orthodoxy has always had other fish to fry. Physics, which <!--
  Page 36 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page36"></a>[36]</span>in
  modern times has almost usurped the name <i>philosophy</i>, in England at
  least, has felt a little disposed to clothe herself with all the honors
  of persecution which belong to the real owner of the name. But the
  bishops, etc. of the Middle Ages knew that the contest between nominalism
  and realism, for instance, had a hundred times more bearing upon
  orthodoxy than anything in astronomy, etc. A wrong notion about
  <i>substance</i> might play the mischief with
  <i>transubstantiation</i>.</p>

  <p>The question of the earth's motion was the single point in which
  orthodoxy came into real contact with science. Many students of physics
  were suspected of magic, many of atheism: but, stupid as the mistake may
  have been, it was <i>bona fide</i> the magic or the atheism, not the
  physics, which was assailed. In the astronomical case it was the very
  doctrine, as a doctrine, independently of consequences, which was the
  <i>corpus delicti</i>: and this because it contradicted the Bible. And so
  it did; for the stability of the earth is as clearly assumed from one end
  of the Old Testament to the other as the solidity of iron. Those who take
  the Bible to be <i>totidem verbis</i> dictated by the God of Truth can
  refuse to believe it; and they make strange reasons. They undertake, <i>a
  priori</i>, to settle Divine intentions. The Holy Spirit did not
  <i>mean</i> to teach natural philosophy: this they know beforehand; or
  else they infer it from finding that the earth does move, and the Bible
  says it does not. Of course, ignorance apart, every word is truth, or the
  writer did not mean truth. But this puts the whole book on its trial: for
  we never can find out what the writer meant, until we otherwise find out
  what is true. Those who like may, of course, declare for an inspiration
  over which they are to be viceroys; but common sense will either accept
  verbal meaning or deny verbal inspiration.</p>

<p class="cenhead">THE STORY OF BURIDAN'S ASS.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>Questiones Morales, folio, 1489 [Paris]. By T. Buridan.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>This is the title from the Hartwell Catalogue of Law Books. I suppose
  it is what is elsewhere called the "Commentary on the Ethics of
  Aristotle," printed in 1489.<a name="NtA_13"
  href="#Nt_13"><sup>[13]</sup></a> Buridan<a name="NtA_14"
  href="#Nt_14"><sup>[14]</sup></a> (died about 1358) is the creator of the
  famous ass which, as <i>Burdin's</i><a name="NtA_15"
  href="#Nt_15"><sup>[15]</sup></a> ass, was current in Burgundy, perhaps
  is, as a vulgar proverb. Spinoza<a name="NtA_16"
  href="#Nt_16"><sup>[16]</sup></a> says it was a jenny ass, and that a man
  would not have been so foolish; but whether the compliment is paid to
  human or to masculine character does not appear&mdash;perhaps to both in
  one. The story <i>told</i> about the famous paradox is very curious. The
  Queen of France, Joanna or Jeanne, was in the habit of sewing her lovers
  up in sacks, and throwing them into the Seine; not for blabbing, but that
  they might not blab&mdash;certainly the safer plan. Buridan was exempted,
  and, in gratitude, invented the sophism. What it has to do with the
  matter <!-- Page 38 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page38"></a>[38]</span>has never been explained. Assuredly <i>qui
  facit per alium facit per se</i> will convict Buridan of prating. The
  argument is as follows, and is seldom told in full. Buridan was for
  free-will&mdash;that is, will which determines conduct, let motives be
  ever so evenly balanced. An ass is <i>equally</i> pressed by hunger and
  by thirst; a bundle of hay is on one side, a pail of water on the other.
  Surely, you will say, he will not be ass enough to die for want of food
  or drink; he will then make a choice&mdash;that is, will choose between
  alternatives of equal force. The problem became famous in the schools;
  some allowed the poor donkey to die of indecision; some denied the
  possibility of the balance, which was no answer at all.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="cenhead">MICHAEL SCOTT'S DEVILS.</p>

  <p>The following question is more difficult, and involves free-will to
  all who answer&mdash;"Which you please." If the northern hemisphere were
  land, and all the southern hemisphere water, ought we to call the
  northern hemisphere an island, or the southern hemisphere a lake? Both
  the questions would be good exercises for paradoxers who must be kept
  employed, like Michael Scott's<a name="NtA_17"
  href="#Nt_17"><sup>[17]</sup></a> devils. The wizard <!-- Page 39
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page39"></a>[39]</span>knew nothing
  about squaring the circle, etc., so he set them to make ropes out of sea
  sand, which puzzled them. Stupid devils; much of our glass is sea sand,
  and it makes beautiful thread. Had Michael set them to square the circle
  or to find a perpetual motion, he would have done his work much better.
  But all this is conjecture: who knows that I have not hit on the very
  plan he adopted? Perhaps the whole race of paradoxers on hopeless
  subjects are Michael's subordinates, condemned to transmigration after
  transmigration, until their task is done.</p>

  <p>The above was not a bad guess. A little after the time when the famous
  Pascal papers<a name="NtA_18" href="#Nt_18"><sup>[18]</sup></a> were
  produced, I came into possession of a correspondence which, but for these
  papers, I should have held too incredible to be put before the world. But
  when one sheep leaps the ditch, another will follow: so I gave the
  following account in the <i>Athenæum</i> of October 5, 1867:</p>

  <p>"The recorded story is that Michael Scott, being bound by contract to
  produce perpetual employment for a number of young demons, was worried
  out of his life in inventing jobs for them, until at last he set them to
  make ropes out of sea sand, which they never could do. We have obtained a
  very curious correspondence between the wizard Michael and his
  demon-slaves; but we do not feel at liberty to say how it came into our
  hands. We much regret that we did not receive it in time for the British
  Association. It appears that the story, true as far as it goes, was never
  finished. The demons easily conquered the rope difficulty, by the simple
  process of making the sand into glass, and spinning the glass into
  thread, which they twisted. Michael, thoroughly disconcerted, hit upon
  the plan of setting some to <!-- Page 40 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page40"></a>[40]</span>square the circle, others to find the
  perpetual motion, etc. He commanded each of them to transmigrate from one
  human body into another, until their tasks were done. This explains the
  whole succession of cyclometers, and all the heroes of the Budget. Some
  of this correspondence is very recent; it is much blotted, and we are not
  quite sure of its meaning: it is full of figurative allusions to driving
  something illegible down a steep into the sea. It looks like a humble
  petition to be allowed some diversion in the intervals of transmigration;
  and the answer is&mdash;</p>

  <p>&mdash;a line of Horace, which the demons interpret as a direction to
  come athwart the proceedings of the Institute by a sly trick. Until we
  saw this, we were suspicious of M. Libri,<a name="NtA_20"
  href="#Nt_20"><sup>[20]</sup></a> the unvarying blunders of the
  correspondence look like knowledge. To be always out of the road requires
  a map: genuine ignorance occasionally lapses into truth. We thought it
  possible M. Libri might have played the trick to show how easily the
  French are deceived; but with our present information, our minds are at
  rest on the subject. We see M. Chasles does not like to avow the real
  source of information: he will not confess himself a spiritualist."</p>

<p class="cenhead">PHILO OF GADARA.</p>

  <p>Philo of Gadara<a name="NtA_21" href="#Nt_21"><sup>[21]</sup></a> is
  asserted by Montucla,<a name="NtA_22" href="#Nt_22"><sup>[22]</sup></a>
  on the <!-- Page 41 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page41"></a>[41]</span>authority of Eutocius,<a name="NtA_23"
  href="#Nt_23"><sup>[23]</sup></a> the commentator on Archimedes, to have
  squared the circle within the <i>ten-thousandth</i> part of a unit, that
  is, to <i>four</i> places of decimals. A modern classical dictionary
  represents it as done by Philo to <i>ten thousand</i> places of decimals.
  Lacroix comments on Montucla to the effect that <i>myriad</i> (in Greek
  <i>ten thousand</i>) is here used as we use it, vaguely, for an immense
  number. On looking into Eutocius, I find that not one definite word is
  said about the extent to which Philo carried the matter. I give a
  translation of the passage:</p>

  <p>"We ought to know that Apollonius Pergæus, in his Ocytocium [this work
  is lost], demonstrated the same by other numbers, and came nearer, which
  seems more accurate, but has nothing to do with Archimedes; for, as
  before said, he aimed only at going near enough for the wants of life.
  Neither is Porus of Nicæa fair when he takes Archimedes to task for not
  giving a line accurately equal to the circumference. He says in his Cerii
  that his teacher, Philo of Gadara, had given a more accurate
  approximation (<span title="eis akribesterous arithmous agagein" class="grk"
  >&epsilon;&#x1F30;&sigmaf;
  &#x1F00;&kappa;&rho;&iota;&beta;&epsilon;&sigma;&tau;&#x1F73;&rho;&omicron;&upsilon;&sigmaf;
  &#x1F00;&rho;&iota;&theta;&mu;&omicron;&#x1F7A;&sigmaf;
  &#x1F00;&gamma;&#x1F71;&gamma;&epsilon;&iota;&nu;</span>) than that of
  Archimedes, or than 7 to 22. But all these [the rest as well as Philo]
  miss the intention. They multiply and divide by <i>tens of thousands</i>,
  which no one can easily do, unless he be versed in the logistics
  [fractional computation] of Magnus [now unknown]."</p>

  <p>Montucla, or his source, ought not to have made this mistake. He had
  been at the Greek to correct Philo <i>Gadetanus</i>, as he had often been
  called, and he had brought away <!-- Page 42 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page42"></a>[42]</span>and quoted <span title="apo Gadarôn" class="grk"
  >&#x1F00;&pi;&#x1F78;
  &Gamma;&#x1F71;&delta;&alpha;&rho;&omega;&nu;</span>. Had he read two
  sentences further, he would have found the mistake.</p>

  <p>We here detect a person quite unnoticed hitherto by the moderns,
  Magnus the arithmetician. The phrase is ironical; it is as if we should
  say, "To do this a man must be deep in Cocker."<a name="NtA_24"
  href="#Nt_24"><sup>[24]</sup></a> Accordingly, Magnus, Baveme,<a
  name="NtA_25" href="#Nt_25"><sup>[25]</sup></a> and Cocker, are three
  personifications of arithmetic; and there may be more.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="cenhead">ON SQUARING THE CIRCLE.</p>

  <p>Aristotle, treating of the category of relation, denies that the
  quadrature has been found, but appears to assume that it can be done.
  Boethius,<a name="NtA_26" href="#Nt_26"><sup>[26]</sup></a> in his
  comment on the passage, says that it has been done since Aristotle, but
  that the demonstration is too long for him to give. Those who have no
  notion of the quadrature question may look at the <i>English
  Cyclopædia</i>, art. "Quadrature of the Circle."</p>

  <p>This book has never been noticed in the history of the subject, and I
  cannot find any mention of it. The quadrature of Campanus<a name="NtA_27"
  href="#Nt_27"><sup>[27]</sup></a> takes the ratio of Archimedes,<a
  name="NtA_28" href="#Nt_28"><sup>[28]</sup></a> 7 to 22 to be absolutely
  correct; the account given of Archimedes is not a translation of his
  book; and that of Boetius has more than is in Boet<i>h</i>ius. This book
  must stand, with the next, as the earliest in print on the subject, until
  further showing: Murhard<a name="NtA_29"

  Lucas Gauricus,<a name="NtA_31" href="#Nt_31"><sup>[31]</sup></a> who has
  given a short preface. Luca Gaurico, Bishop of Civita Ducale, an
  astrologer of astrologers, published this work at about thirty years of
  age, and lived to eighty-two. His works are collected in folios, but I do
  not know whether they contain this production. The poor fellow could
  never tell his own fortune, because his father neglected to note the hour
  and minute of his birth. But if there had been anything in astrology, he
  could have worked back, as Adams<a name="NtA_32"
  href="#Nt_32"><sup>[32]</sup></a> and Leverrier<a name="NtA_33"
  href="#Nt_33"><sup>[33]</sup></a> did when they caught <!-- Page 44
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page44"></a>[44]</span>Neptune: at
  sixty he could have examined every minute of his day of birth, by the
  events of his life, and so would have found the right minute. He could
  then have gone on, by rules of prophecy. Gauricus was the mathematical
  teacher of Joseph Scaliger,<a name="NtA_34"

  see.</p>

<p class="cenhead">BOVILLUS ON THE QUADRATURE PROBLEM.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>In hoc opere contenta Epitome.... Liber de quadratura Circuli....
  Paris, 1503, folio.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The quadrator is Charles Bovillus,<a name="NtA_35"
  href="#Nt_35"><sup>[35]</sup></a> who adopted the views of Cardinal
  Cusa,<a name="NtA_36" href="#Nt_36"><sup>[36]</sup></a> presently
  mentioned. Montucla is hard on his compatriot, who, he says, was only
  saved from the laughter of geometers by his obscurity. Persons must guard
  against most historians of mathematics in one point: they frequently
  attribute to <i>his own</i> age the obscurity which a writer has in
  <i>their own</i> time. This tract was printed by Henry Stephens,<a
  name="NtA_37" href="#Nt_37"><sup>[37]</sup></a> at the instigation of
  Faber Stapulensis,<a name="NtA_38" href="#Nt_38"><sup>[38]</sup></a> <!--
  Page 45 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page45"></a>[45]</span>and is
  recorded by Dechales,<a name="NtA_39" href="#Nt_39"><sup>[39]</sup></a>
  etc. It was also introduced into the <i>Margarita Philosophica</i> of
  1815,<a name="NtA_40" href="#Nt_40"><sup>[40]</sup></a> in the same
  appendix with the new perspective from Viator. This is not extreme
  obscurity, by any means. The quadrature deserved it; but that is another
  point.</p>

  <p>It is stated by Montucla that Bovillus makes <span
  class="grk">&pi;</span> = &radic;10. But Montucla cites a work of 1507,
  <i>Introductorium Geometricum</i>, which I have never seen.<a
  name="NtA_41" href="#Nt_41"><sup>[41]</sup></a> He finds in it an account
  which Bovillus gives of the quadrature of the peasant laborer, and
  describes it as agreeing with his own. But the description makes <span
  class="grk">&pi;</span> = 3-1/8, which it thus appears Bovillus could not
  distinguish from &radic;10. It seems also that this 3-1/8, about which we
  shall see so much in the sequel, takes its rise in the thoughtful head of
  a poor laborer. It does him great honor, being so near the truth, and he
  having no means of instruction. In our day, when an ignorant person
  chooses to bring his fancy forward in opposition to demonstration which
  he will not study, he is deservedly laughed at.</p>

<p class="cenhead">THE STORY OF LACOMME'S ATTEMPT AT QUADRATURE.</p>

  <p>Mr. James Smith,<a name="NtA_42" href="#Nt_42"><sup>[42]</sup></a> of
  Liverpool&mdash;hereinafter notorified&mdash;attributes the first
  announcement of 3-1/8 to M. Joseph Lacomme, a French well-sinker, of whom
  he gives the following account:</p>

  <p>"In the year 1836, at which time Lacomme could neither read nor write,
  he had constructed a circular reservoir and wished to know the quantity
  of stone that would be required to pave the bottom, and for this purpose
  called on a professor of mathematics. On putting his question and giving
  the diameter, he was surprised at getting the following answer from the
  Professor: <i>'Qu'il lui était impossible de le lui dire au juste,
  attendu que personne n'avait encore pu trouver d'une manière exacte le
  rapport de la circonférence au diametre.'</i><a name="NtA_43"
  href="#Nt_43"><sup>[43]</sup></a> From this he was led to attempt the
  solution of the problem. His first process was purely mechanical, and he
  was so far convinced he had made the discovery that he took to educating
  himself, and became an expert arithmetician, and then found that
  arithmetical results agreed with his mechanical experiments. He appears
  to have eked out a bare existence for many years by teaching arithmetic,
  all the time struggling to get a hearing from some of the learned
  societies, but without success. In the year 1855 he found his way to
  Paris, where, as if by accident, he made the acquaintance of a young
  gentleman, son of M. Winter, a commissioner of police, and taught him his
  peculiar methods of calculation. The young man was so enchanted that he
  strongly recommended Lacomme to his father, and <!-- Page 47 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page47"></a>[47]</span>subsequently through M.
  Winter he obtained an introduction to the President of the Society of
  Arts and Sciences of Paris. A committee of the society was appointed to
  examine and report upon his discovery, and the society at its
  <i>séance</i> of March 17, 1856, awarded a silver medal of the first
  class to M. Joseph Lacomme for his discovery of the true ratio of
  diameter to circumference in a circle. He subsequently received three
  other medals from other societies. While writing this I have his likeness
  before me, with his medals on his breast, which stands as a frontispiece
  to a short biography of this extraordinary man, for which I am indebted
  to the gentleman who did me the honor to publish a French translation of
  the pamphlet I distributed at the meeting of the British Association for
  the Advancement of Science, at Oxford, in
  1860."&mdash;<i>Correspondent</i>, May 3, 1866.</p>

  <p>My inquiries show that the story of the medals is not incredible.
  There are at Paris little private societies which have not so much claim
  to be exponents of scientific opinion as our own Mechanics' Institutes.
  Some of them were intended to give a false lustre: as the "Institut
  Historique," the members of which are "Membre de l'Institut Historique."
  That M. Lacomme should have got four medals from societies of this class
  is very possible: that he should have received one from any society at
  Paris which has the least claim to give one is as yet simply
  incredible.</p>

<p class="cenhead">WHICH LEADS TO WALTER SCOTT.</p>

  <p>Walter Scott, it is well known, was curious on all matters connected
  with magic, and has used them very widely. But it is hardly known how
  much pains he has taken to be correct, and to give the real thing. The
  most decided detail of a magical process which is found in his writings
  is that of Dousterswivel in <i>The Antiquary</i>; and it is obvious, by
  his accuracy of process, that he does not intend the adept for a mere
  impostor, but for one who had a lurking belief in the efficacy of his own
  processes, coupled with intent to make a fraudulent use of them. The
  materials for the process are taken from Agrippa. I first quote Mr.
  Dousterswivel:</p>

  <p>"... I take a silver plate when she [the moon] is in her fifteenth
  mansion, which mansion is in de head of <i>Libra</i>, and I engrave upon
  one side de worts <i>Schedbarschemoth Scharta</i>ch<i>an</i> [<i>ch</i>
  should be <i>t</i>]&mdash;dat is, de Intelligence of de Intelligence of
  de moon&mdash;and I make his picture like a flying serpent with a
  turkey-cock's head&mdash;vary well&mdash;Then upon this side I make de
  table of de moon, which is a square of nine, multiplied into itself, with
  eighty-one numbers [nine] on every side and diameter nine...."</p>

  <p>In the <i>De Occulta Philosophia</i>, p. 290, we find that the
  fifteenth mansion of the moon <i>incipit capite Libræ</i>, and is good
  <i>pro extrahendis thesauris</i>, the object being to discover hidden
  treasure. In p. 246, we learn that a <i>silver</i> plate must be used
  with the moon. In p. 248, we have the words which denote the
  Intelligence, etc. But, owing to the falling of a number into a wrong
  line, or the misplacement of a line, one or other&mdash;which takes place
  in all the editions I have examined&mdash;Scott has, sad to say, got hold
  of the wrong words; he has written down the <i>demon of the demons</i> of
  the moon. Instead of the gibberish above, it should have been <i>Malcha
  betarsisim hed beruah schenhakim</i>. In p. 253, we have the magic square
  of the moon, with eighty-one numbers, and the symbol for the
  Intelligence, which Scott likens to a flying <!-- Page 50 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page50"></a>[50]</span>serpent with a
  turkey-cock's head. He was obliged to say something; but I will stake my
  character&mdash;and so save a woodcut&mdash;on the scratches being more
  like a pair of legs, one shorter than the other, without a body, jumping
  over a six-barred gate placed side uppermost. Those who thought that
  Scott forged his own nonsense, will henceforth stand corrected. As to the
  spirit Peolphan, etc., no doubt Scott got it from the authors he
  elsewhere mentions, Nicolaus Remigius<a name="NtA_47"
  href="#Nt_47"><sup>[47]</sup></a> and Petrus Thyracus; but this last word
  should be Thyræus.</p>

  <p>The tendency of Scott's mind towards prophecy is very marked, and it
  is always fulfilled. Hyder, in his disguise, calls out to Tippoo: "Cursed
  is the prince who barters justice for lust; he shall die in the gate by
  the sword of the stranger." Tippoo was killed in a gateway at
  Seringapatam.<a name="NtA_48" href="#Nt_48"><sup>[48]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Orontius<a name="NtA_49" href="#Nt_49"><sup>[49]</sup></a> squared the
  circle out of all comprehension; but he was killed by a feather from his

  href="#Nt_50"><sup>[50]</sup></a> the same who&mdash;I believe for the
  first time&mdash;calculated the question of Noah's ark, as to its power
  to hold all the animals and stores, unsquared him completely. Orontius
  was the author of very many works, and died in 1555. Among the laudatory
  verses which, as was usual, precede this work, there is one of a rare
  character: a congratulatory ode to the wife of the author. The French now
  call this writer Oronce Finée; but there is much difficulty about
  delatinization. Is this more correct than Oronce Fine, which the
  translator of De Thou uses? Or than Horonce Phine, which older writers
  give? I cannot understand why M. de Viette<a name="NtA_51"
  href="#Nt_51"><sup>[51]</sup></a> should be called Viète, because his
  Latin name is Vieta. It is difficult to restore Buteo; for not only now
  is <i>butor</i> a blockhead as well as a bird, but we really cannot know
  what kind of bird Buteo stood for. We may be sure that Madame Fine was
  Denise Blanche; for Dionysia Candida can mean nothing else. Let her shade
  rejoice in the fame which Hubertus Sussannæus has given her.</p>

  <p>I ought to add that the quadrature of Orontius, and solutions of all
  the other difficulties, were first published in <i>De Rebus Mathematicis

  the verses at the beginning instead of the end; he says the circle thanks
  its quadrator affectionately; and he says the good and modest chevalier
  gives all the glory to the patron saint of his order. All of little
  consequence, as it happens; but writing at second-hand makes as complete
  mistakes about more important matters.</p>

<p class="cenhead">BUNGUS ON THE MYSTERY OF NUMBER.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>Petri Bungi Bergomatis Numerorum mysteria. Bergomi [Bergamo], 1591,
  4to. Second Edition.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The first edition is said to be of 1585;<a name="NtA_62"
  href="#Nt_62"><sup>[62]</sup></a> the third, Paris, 1618. Bungus is not
  for my purpose on his own score, but those who gave the numbers their
  mysterious characters: he is but a collector. He quotes or uses 402
  authors, as we are informed by his list; this just beats Warburton,<a
  name="NtA_63" href="#Nt_63"><sup>[63]</sup></a> whom some eulogist or
  satirist, I forget which, holds up as having used 400 authors in some one
  work. Bungus goes through 1, 2, 3, etc., and gives the account of
  everything remarkable in which each number occurs; his accounts not being
  always mysterious. The numbers which have nothing to say for themselves
  are omitted: thus there is a gap between 50 and 60. In treating 666,
  Bungus, a good Catholic, could not compliment the Pope with it, but he
  fixes it on Martin Luther with a little forcing. If from A to I represent
  1-10, from K to S 10-90, and from T to Z 100-500, we see:</p>

<table class="nobctr" width="50%" summary="Martin Lutera 666" title="Martin Lutera 666">

  <p>which gives 666. Again, in Hebrew, <i>Lulter</i> does the same:</p>

<table class="nobctr" width="25%" summary="Hebrew Lulter 666" title="Hebrew Lulter 666">

<td align="center">400</td>
<td align="center">30</td>
<td align="center">6</td>
<td align="center">30</td></tr>
</table>

  <p>And thus two can play at any game. The second is better than the
  first: to Latinize the surname and not the Christian <!-- Page 56
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page56"></a>[56]</span>name is very
  unscholarlike. The last number mentioned is a thousand millions; all
  greater numbers are dismissed in half a page. Then follows an accurate
  distinction between <i>number</i> and <i>multitude</i>&mdash;a thing much
  wanted both in arithmetic and logic.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="cenhead">WHICH LEADS TO A STORY ABOUT THE ROYAL SOCIETY.</p>

  <p>What may be the use of such a book as this? The last occasion on which
  it was used was the following. Fifteen or sixteen years ago the Royal
  Society determined to restrict the number of yearly admissions to fifteen
  men of science, and noblemen <i>ad libitum</i>; the men of science being
  selected and recommended by the Council, with a power, since practically
  surrendered, to the Society to elect more. This plan appears to me to be
  directly against the spirit of their charter, the true intent of which
  is, that all who are fit should be allowed to promote natural knowledge
  in association, from and after the time at which they are both fit and
  willing. It is also working more absurdly from year to year; the tariff
  of fifteen per annum will soon amount to the practical exclusion of many
  who would be very useful. This begins to be felt already, I suspect. But,
  as appears above, the body of the Society has the remedy in its own
  hands. When the alteration was discussed by the Council, my friend the
  late Mr. Galloway,<a name="NtA_64" href="#Nt_64"><sup>[64]</sup></a> then
  one of the body, opposed it strongly, and inquired particularly into the
  reason why <i>fifteen</i>, of all numbers, was the one to be selected.
  Was it because fifteen is seven and eight, typifying the Old Testament
  Sabbath, and the New Testament day of the resurrection following? Was it
  because Paul strove fifteen days against Peter, proving that he was a
  doctor both of the Old and New Testament? Was it because the prophet
  Hosea bought a lady <!-- Page 57 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page57"></a>[57]</span>for fifteen pieces of silver? Was it
  because, according to Micah, seven shepherds and eight chiefs should
  waste the Assyrians? Was it because Ecclesiastes commands equal reverence
  to be given to both Testaments&mdash;such was the interpretation&mdash;in
  the words "Give a portion to seven, and also to eight"? Was it because
  the waters of the Deluge rose fifteen cubits above the
  mountains?&mdash;or because they lasted fifteen decades of days? Was it
  because Ezekiel's temple had fifteen steps? Was it because Jacob's ladder
  has been supposed to have had fifteen steps? Was it because fifteen years
  were added to the life of Hezekiah? Was it because the feast of
  unleavened bread was on the fifteenth day of the month? Was it because
  the scene of the Ascension was fifteen stadia from Jerusalem? Was it
  because the stone-masons and porters employed in Solomon's temple
  amounted to fifteen myriads? etc. The Council were amused and astounded
  by the volley of fifteens which was fired at them; they knowing nothing
  about Bungus, of which Mr. Galloway&mdash;who did not, as the French say,
  indicate his sources&mdash;possessed the copy now before me. In giving
  this anecdote I give a specimen of the book, which is exceedingly rare.
  Should another edition ever appear, which is not very probable, he would
  be but a bungling Bungus who should forget the <i>fifteen</i> of the
  Royal Society.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="cenhead">AND ALSO TO A QUESTION OF EVIDENCE.</p>

  <p>[I make a remark on the different colors which the same person gives
  to one story, according to the bias under which he tells it. My friend
  Galloway told me how he had quizzed the Council of the Royal Society, to
  my great amusement. Whenever I am struck by the words of any one, I carry
  away a vivid recollection of position, gestures, tones, etc. I do not
  know whether this be common or uncommon. I never recall this joke without
  seeing before me my friend, leaning against his bookcase, with Bungus
  open in his hand, and a certain half-depreciatory tone which he often
  used <!-- Page 58 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page58"></a>[58]</span>when speaking of himself. Long after his
  death, an F.R.S. who was present at the discussion, told me the story. I
  did not say I had heard it, but I watched him, with Galloway at the
  bookcase before me. I wanted to see whether the two would agree as to the
  fact of an enormous budget of fifteens having been fired at the Council,
  and they did agree perfectly. But when the paragraph of the Budget
  appeared in the <i>Athenæum</i>, my friend, who seemed rather to object
  to the <i>showing-up</i>, assured me that the thing was grossly
  exaggerated; there was indeed a fifteen or two, but nothing like the
  number I had given. I had, however, taken sharp note of the previous
  narration.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="cenhead">AND TO ANOTHER QUESTION OF EVIDENCE.</p>

  <p>I will give another instance. An Indian officer gave me an account of
  an elephant, as follows. A detachment was on the march, and one of the
  gun-carriages got a wheel off the track, so that it was also off the
  ground, and hanging over a precipice. If the bullocks had moved a step,
  carriages, bullocks, and all must have been precipitated. No one knew
  what could be done until some one proposed to bring up an elephant, and
  let him manage it his own way. The elephant took a moment's survey of the
  fix, put his trunk under the axle of the free wheel, and waited. The
  surrounders, who saw what he meant, moved the bullocks gently forward,
  the elephant followed, supporting the axle, until there was ground under
  the wheel, when he let it quietly down. From all I had heard of the
  elephant, this was not too much to believe. But when, years afterwards, I
  reminded my friend of his story, he assured me that I had misunderstood
  him, that the elephant was <i>directed</i> to put his trunk under the
  wheel, and saw in a moment why. This is reasonable sagacity, and very
  likely the correct account; but I am quite sure that, in the fit of
  elephant-worship under which the story was first told, it was told as I
  have first stated it.] <!-- Page 59 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  <p>I cannot imagine how I came to omit a writer whom I have known so many
  years, unless the following story will explain it. The officer reproved
  the boatswain for perpetual swearing; the boatswain answered that he
  heard the officers swear. "Only in an emergency," said the officer.
  "That's just it," replied the other; "a boatswain's life is a life of
  'mergency." Giordano Bruno was all paradox; and my mind was not alive to
  his paradoxes, just as my ears might have become dead to the boatswain's
  oaths. He was, as has been said, a vorticist before Descartes,<a
  name="NtA_66" href="#Nt_66"><sup>[66]</sup></a> an optimist before
  Leibnitz, a Copernican before Galileo. It would be easy to collect a
  hundred strange opinions of his. He was born about 1550, and was roasted
  alive at Rome, February 17, 1600, for the maintenance and defence of the
  holy Church, and the rights and liberties of the same. These last words
  are from the writ of our own good James I, under which Leggatt<a
  name="NtA_67" href="#Nt_67"><sup>[67]</sup></a> was roasted at
  Smithfield, in March 1612; and if I had a copy of the instrument under
  which Wightman<a name="NtA_68" href="#Nt_68"><sup>[68]</sup></a> was
  roasted at Lichfield, a month afterwards, I daresay I should <!-- Page 60
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page60"></a>[60]</span>find something
  quite as edifying. I extract an account which I gave of Bruno in the
  <i>Comp. Alm.</i> for 1855:</p>

  <p>"He was first a Dominican priest, then a Calvinist; and was roasted
  alive at Rome, in 1600, for as many heresies of opinion, religious and
  philosophical, as ever lit one fire. Some defenders of the papal cause
  have at least worded their accusations so to be understood as imputing to
  him villainous actions. But it is positively certain that his death was
  due to opinions alone, and that retractation, even after sentence, would
  have saved him. There exists a remarkable letter, written from Rome on
  the very day of the murder, by Scioppius<a name="NtA_69"
  href="#Nt_69"><sup>[69]</sup></a> (the celebrated scholar, a waspish
  convert from Lutheranism, known by his hatred to Protestants and Jesuits)
  to Rittershusius,<a name="NtA_70" href="#Nt_70"><sup>[70]</sup></a> a
  well-known Lutheran writer on civil and canon law, whose works are in the
  index of prohibited books. This letter has been reprinted by Libri (vol.
  iv. p. 407). The writer informs his friend (whom he wished to convince
  that even a Lutheran would have burnt Bruno) that all Rome would tell him
  that Bruno died for Lutheranism; but this is because the Italians do not
  know the difference between one heresy and another, in which simplicity
  (says the writer) may God preserve them. That is to say, they knew the
  difference between a live heretic and a roasted one by actual inspection,
  but had no idea of the difference between a Lutheran and a Calvinist. The
  countrymen of Boccaccio would have smiled at the idea which the German
  scholar entertained of them. They said Bruno was burnt for Lutheranism, a
  name under which they classed all Protestants: and they are better
  witnesses than Schopp, or Scioppius. He then proceeds to describe to his
  Protestant friend (to whom he would certainly not have omitted any act
  which both their churches would have condemned) the mass of opinions with
  which Bruno was charged; as that there <!-- Page 61 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page61"></a>[61]</span>are innumerable worlds,
  that souls migrate, that Moses was a magician, that the Scriptures are a
  dream, that only the Hebrews descended from Adam and Eve, that the devils
  would be saved, that Christ was a magician and deservedly put to death,
  etc. In fact, says he, Bruno has advanced all that was ever brought
  forward by all heathen philosophers, and by all heretics, ancient and
  modern. A time for retractation was given, both before sentence and
  after, which should be noted, as well for the wretched palliation which
  it may afford, as for the additional proof it gives that opinions, and
  opinions only, brought him to the stake. In this medley of charges the
  Scriptures are a dream, while Adam, Eve, devils, and salvation are
  truths, and the Saviour a deceiver. We have examined no work of Bruno
  except the <i>De Monade</i>, etc., mentioned in the text. A strong though
  strange <i>theism</i> runs through the whole, and Moses, Christ, the
  Fathers, etc., are cited in a manner which excites no remark either way.
  Among the versions of the cause of Bruno's death is <i>atheism</i>: but
  this word was very often used to denote rejection of revelation, not
  merely in the common course of dispute, but by such writers, for
  instance, as Brucker<a name="NtA_71" href="#Nt_71"><sup>[71]</sup></a>
  and Morhof.<a name="NtA_72" href="#Nt_72"><sup>[72]</sup></a> Thus Morhof
  says of the <i>De Monade, etc.</i>, that it exhibits no manifest signs of
  atheism. What he means by the word is clear enough, when he thus speaks
  of a work which acknowledges God in hundreds of places, and rejects
  opinions as blasphemous in several. The work of Bruno in which his
  astronomical opinions are contained is <i>De Monade, etc.</i> (Frankfort,
  1591, 8vo). He is the most thorough-going Copernican possible, and throws
  out almost every opinion, true or false, which has ever been discussed by
  astronomers, from the theory of innumerable inhabited worlds and systems
  to that <!-- Page 62 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page62"></a>[62]</span>of the planetary nature of comets. Libri
  (vol. iv)<a name="NtA_73" href="#Nt_73"><sup>[73]</sup></a> has reprinted
  the most striking part of his expressions of Copernican opinion."</p>

<p class="cenhead">THIS LEADS TO THE CHURCH QUESTION.</p>

  <p>The Satanic doctrine that a church may employ force in aid of its
  dogma is supposed to be obsolete in England, except as an individual
  paradox; but this is difficult to settle. Opinions are much divided as to
  what the Roman Church would do in England, if she could: any one who
  doubts that she claims the right does not deserve an answer. When the
  hopes of the Tractarian section of the High Church were in bloom, before
  the most conspicuous intellects among them had <i>transgressed</i> their
  ministry, that they might go to their own place, I had the curiosity to
  see how far it could be ascertained whether they held the only doctrine
  which makes me the personal enemy of a sect. I found in one of their
  tracts the assumption of a right to persecute, modified by an asserted
  conviction that force was not efficient. I cannot now say that this tract
  was one of the celebrated ninety; and on looking at the collection I find
  it so poorly furnished with contents, etc., that nothing but searching
  through three thick volumes would decide. In these volumes I find,
  augmenting as we go on, declarations about the character and power of
  "the Church" which have a suspicious appearance. The suspicion is
  increased by that curious piece of sophistry, No. 87, on religious
  reserve. The queer paradoxes of that tract leave us in doubt as to
  everything but this, that the church(man) is not bound to give his whole
  counsel in all things, and not bound to say what the things are in which
  he does not give it. It is likely enough that some of the "rights and
  liberties" are but scantily described. There is now no fear; but the time
  was when, if not fear, there might be a looking for of fear to come;
  nobody could then be so <!-- Page 63 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page63"></a>[63]</span>sure as we now are that the lion was only
  asleep. There was every appearance of a harder fight at hand than was
  really found needful.</p>

  <p>Among other exquisite quirks of interpretation in the No. 87 above
  mentioned is the following. God himself employs reserve; he is said to be
  decked with light as with a garment (the old or prayer-book version of
  Psalm civ. 2). To an ordinary apprehension this would be a strong image
  of display, manifestation, revelation; but there is something more. "Does
  not a garment veil in some measure that which it clothes? Is not that
  very light concealment?"</p>

  <p>This No. 87, admitted into a series, fixes upon the managers of the
  series, who permitted its introduction, a strong presumption of that
  underhand intent with which they were charged. At the same time it is
  honorable to our liberty that this series could be published: though its
  promoters were greatly shocked when the Essayists and Bishop Colenso<a
  name="NtA_74" href="#Nt_74"><sup>[74]</sup></a> took a swing on the other
  side. When No. 90 was under discussion, Dr. Maitland,<a name="NtA_75"
  href="#Nt_75"><sup>[75]</sup></a> the librarian at Lambeth, asked
  Archbishop Howley<a name="NtA_76" href="#Nt_76"><sup>[76]</sup></a> a
  question about No. 89. "I did not so much as know there <i>was</i> a No.
  89," was the answer. I am almost sure I have seen this in print, and
  quite sure that Dr. Maitland told it to me. It is creditable that there
  was so much freedom; but No. 90 was <i>too bad</i>, and was stopped.</p>

  <p>The Tractarian mania has now (October 1866) settled down into a
  chronic vestment disease, complicated with fits of transubstantiation,
  which has taken the name of <!-- Page 64 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page64"></a>[64]</span><i>Ritualism</i>. The common sense of our
  national character will not put up with a continuance of this grotesque
  folly; millinery in all its branches will at last be advertised only over
  the proper shops. I am told that the Ritualists give short and practical
  sermons; if so, they may do good in the end. The English Establishment
  has always contained those who want an excitement; the New Testament, in
  its plain meaning, can do little for them. Since the Revolution,
  Jacobitism, Wesleyanism, Evangelicism, Puseyism,<a name="NtA_77"
  href="#Nt_77"><sup>[77]</sup></a> and Ritualism, have come on in turn,
  and have furnished hot water for those who could not wash without it. If
  the Ritualists should succeed in substituting short and practical
  teaching for the high-spiced lectures of the doctrinalists, they will be
  remembered with praise. John the Baptist would perhaps not have brought
  all Jerusalem out into the wilderness by his plain and good sermons: it
  was the camel's hair and the locusts which got him a congregation, and
  which, perhaps, added force to his precepts. When at school I heard a
  dialogue, between an usher and the man who cleaned the shoes, about Mr.
  &mdash;&mdash;, a minister, a very corporate body with due area of
  waistcoat. "He is a man of great erudition," said the first. "Ah, yes
  sir," said Joe; "any one can see that who looks at that silk
  waistcoat."]</p>

<p class="cenhead">OF THOMAS GEPHYRANDER SALICETUS.</p>

  <p>[When I said at the outset that I had only taken books from my own
  store, I should have added that I did not make any search for information
  given as <i>part</i> of a work. Had I looked <i>through</i> all my books,
  I might have made some curious additions. For instance, in Schott's
  <i>Magia Naturalis</i><a name="NtA_78" href="#Nt_78"><sup>[78]</sup></a>
  <!-- Page 65 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page65"></a>[65]</span>(vol. iii. pp. 756-778) is an account of the
  quadrature of Gephyra<i>u</i>der, as he is misprinted in Montucla. He was
  Thomas Gephyrander Salicetus; and he published two editions, in 1608 and
  1609.<a name="NtA_79" href="#Nt_79"><sup>[79]</sup></a> I never even
  heard of a copy of either. His work is of the extreme of absurdity: he
  makes a distinction between geometrical and arithmetical fractions, and
  evolves theorems from it. More curious than his quadrature is his name;
  what are we to make of it? If a German, he is probably a German form of
  <i>Bridgeman</i>. and Salicetus refers him to <i>Weiden</i>. But
  <i>Thomas</i> was hardly a German Christian name of his time; of 526
  German philosophers, physicians, lawyers, and theologians who were
  biographed by Melchior Adam,<a name="NtA_80"
  href="#Nt_80"><sup>[80]</sup></a> only two are of this name. Of these one
  is Thomas Erastus,<a name="NtA_81" href="#Nt_81"><sup>[81]</sup></a> the
  physician whose theological writings against the Church as a separate
  power have given the name of Erastians to those who follow his doctrine,
  whether they have heard of him or not. Erastus is little known;
  accordingly, some have supposed that he must be Erastus, the friend of
  St. Paul and Timothy (Acts xix. 22; 2 Tim. iv. 20; Rom. xvi. 23), but
  what this gentleman did to earn the character is not hinted at. Few words
  would have done: Gaius (Rom. xvi. 23) has an immortality which many more
  noted men have missed, given by John Bunyan, out of seven words of St.
  Paul. I was once told that the Erastians got their name from
  <i>Blastus</i>, and I could not solve <i>bl = er</i>: at last I
  remembered that Blastus was a <i>chamberlain</i><a name="NtA_82"
  href="#Nt_82"><sup>[82]</sup></a> as well as Erastus; hence the
  association which <!-- Page 66 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page66"></a>[66]</span>caused the mistake. The real heresiarch was
  a physician who died in 1583; his heresy was promulgated in a work,
  published immediately after his death by his widow, <i>De
  Excommunicatione Ecclesiastica</i>. He denied the power of
  excommunication on the principle above stated; and was answered by
  Besa.<a name="NtA_83" href="#Nt_83"><sup>[83]</sup></a> The work was
  translated by Dr. R. Lee<a name="NtA_84"
  href="#Nt_84"><sup>[84]</sup></a> (Edinb. 1844, 8vo). The other is Thomas
  Grynæus,<a name="NtA_85" href="#Nt_85"><sup>[85]</sup></a> a theologian,
  nephew of Simon, who first printed Euclid in Greek; of him Adam says that
  of works he published none, of learned sons four. If Gephyrander were a
  Frenchman, his name is not so easily guessed at; but he must have been of
  La Saussaye. The account given by Schott is taken from a certain Father
  Philip Colbinus, who wrote against him.</p>

  <p>In some manuscripts lately given to the Royal Society, David
  Gregory,<a name="NtA_86" href="#Nt_86"><sup>[86]</sup></a> who seems to
  have seen Gephyrander's work, calls him Salicetus <i>Westphalus</i>,
  which is probably on the title-page. But the only Weiden I can find is in
  Bavaria. Murhard has both editions in his Catalogue, but had plainly
  never seen the books: he gives the author as Thomas Gep. Hyandrus,
  Salicettus Westphalus. Murhard is a very old referee of mine; but who the
  <i>non nominandus</i> was to see Montucla's <i>Gephyrander</i> in
  Murhard's <i>Gep. Hyandrus</i>, both writers being usually accurate?]</p>

  will have the circle to be exactly 3 diameters and 69/484 of a diameter.
  Cataldi, taking Van Ceulen's approximation, works hard at the finding of
  integers which nearly represent the ratio. He had not then the
  <i>continued fraction</i>, a mode of representation which he gave the
  next year in his work on the square root. He has but twenty of Van

  taught Newton and all his successors how to philosophize. That Newton
  never mentions Bacon, nor alludes in any way to his works, passed for
  nothing. Here and there a paradoxer ventured not to find all this
  teaching in Bacon, but he was pronounced blind. In our day it begins to
  be seen that, great as Bacon was, and great as his book really is, he is
  not the philosophical father of modern discovery.</p>

  <p>But old prepossession will find reason for anything. A learned friend
  of mine wrote to me that he had discovered proof that Newton owned Bacon
  for his master: the proof was that Newton, in some of his earlier
  writings, used the <!-- Page 76 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page76"></a>[76]</span>phrase <i>experimentum crucis</i>, which is
  Bacon's. Newton may have read some of Bacon, though no proof of it
  appears. I have a dim idea that I once saw the two words attributed to
  the alchemists: if so, there is another explanation; for Newton was
  deeply read in the alchemists.</p>

  <p>I subjoin a review which I wrote of the splendid edition of Bacon by
  Spedding,<a name="NtA_112" href="#Nt_112"><sup>[112]</sup></a> Ellis,<a

  <p>No knowledge of nature without experiment and observation: so said
  Aristotle, so said Bacon, so acted Copernicus, Tycho Brahé,<a

  href="#Nt_117"><sup>[117]</sup></a> No derived knowledge <i>until</i>
  experiment and observation are concluded: so said Bacon, and no one else.
  We do not mean to say that he laid down his principle in these words, or
  that he carried it to the utmost extreme: we mean that Bacon's ruling
  idea was the <!-- Page 77 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page77"></a>[77]</span>collection of enormous masses of facts, and
  then digested processes of arrangement and elimination, so artistically
  contrived, that a man of common intelligence, without any unusual
  sagacity, should be able to announce the truth sought for. Let Bacon
  speak for himself, in his editor's English:</p>

  <p>"But the course I propose for the discovery of sciences is such as
  leaves but little to the acuteness and strength of wits, but places all
  wits and understandings nearly on a level. For, as in the drawing of a
  straight line or a perfect circle, much depends on the steadiness and
  practice of the hand, if it be done by aim of hand only, but if with the
  aid of rule or compass little or nothing, so it is exactly with my
  plan.... For my way of discovering sciences goes far to level men's wits,
  and leaves but little to individual excellence; because it performs
  everything by the surest rules and demonstrations."</p>

  <p>To show that we do not strain Bacon's meaning, we add what is said by
  Hooke,<a name="NtA_118" href="#Nt_118"><sup>[118]</sup></a> whom we have
  already mentioned as his professed disciple, and, we believe, his only
  disciple of the day of Newton. We must, however, remind the reader that
  Hooke was very little of a mathematician, and spoke of algebra from his
  own idea of what others had told him:</p>

  <p>"The intellect is not to be suffered to act without its helps, but is
  continually to be assisted by some method or engine, which shall be as a
  guide to regulate its actions, so as that it shall not be able to act
  amiss. Of this engine, no man except the incomparable Verulam hath had
  any thoughts and he indeed hath promoted it to a very good pitch; but
  there is yet somewhat more to be added, which he seemed to want time to
  complete. By this, as by that <!-- Page 78 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page78"></a>[78]</span>art of algebra in geometry, 'twill be very
  easy to proceed in any natural inquiry, regularly and certainly.... For
  as 'tis very hard for the most acute wit to find out any difficult
  problem in geometry without the help of algebra ... and altogether as
  easy for the meanest capacity acting by that method to complete and
  perfect it, so will it be in the inquiry after natural knowledge."</p>

  <p>Bacon did not live to mature the whole of this plan. Are we really to
  believe that if he had completed the <i>Instauratio</i> we who write
  this&mdash;and who feel ourselves growing bigger as we write
  it&mdash;should have been on a level with Newton in physical discovery?
  Bacon asks this belief of us, and does not get it. But it may be said,
  Your business is with what he <i>did</i> leave, and with its
  consequences. Be it so. Mr. Ellis says: "That his method is impracticable
  cannot, I think, be denied, if we reflect not only that it never has
  produced any result, but also that the process by which scientific truths
  have been established cannot be so presented as even to appear to be in
  accordance with it." That this is very true is well known to all who have
  studied the history of discovery: those who deny it are bound to
  establish either that some great discovery has been made by Bacon's
  method&mdash;we mean by the part peculiar to Bacon&mdash;or, better
  still, to show that some new discovery can be made, by actually making
  it. No general talk about <i>induction</i>: no reliance upon the mere
  fact that certain experiments or observations have been made; let us see
  where <i>Bacon's induction</i> has been actually used or can be used.
  Mere induction, <i>enumeratio simplex</i>, is spoken of by himself with
  contempt, as utterly incompetent. For Bacon knew well that a thousand
  instances may be contradicted by the thousand and first: so that no
  enumeration of instances, however large, is "sure demonstration," so long
  any are left.</p>

  <p>The immortal Harvey, who was <i>inventing</i>&mdash;we use the word in
  its old sense&mdash;the circulation of the blood, while <!-- Page 79
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page79"></a>[79]</span>Bacon was in the
  full flow of thought upon his system, may be trusted to say whether, when
  the system appeared, he found any likeness in it to his own processes, or
  what would have been any help to him, if he had waited for the <i>Novum
  Organum</i>. He said of Bacon, "He writes philosophy like a Lord
  Chancellor." This has been generally supposed to be only a sneer at the
  <i>sutor ultra crepidam</i>; but we cannot help suspecting that there was
  more intended by it. To us, Bacon is eminently the philosopher of
  <i>error prevented</i>, not of <i>progress facilitated</i>. When we throw
  off the idea of being <i>led right</i>, and betake ourselves to that of
  being <i>kept from going wrong</i>, we read his writings with a sense of
  their usefulness, his genius, and their probable effect upon purely
  experimental science, which we can be conscious of upon no other
  supposition. It amuses us to have to add that the part of Aristotle's
  logic of which he saw the value was the book on <i>refutation of
  fallacies</i>. Now is this not the notion of things to which the bias of
  a practised lawyer might lead him? In the case which is before the Court,
  generally speaking, truth lurks somewhere about the facts, and the
  elimination of all error will show it in the residuum. The two senses of
  the word <i>law</i> come in so as to look almost like a play upon words.
  The judge can apply the law so soon as the facts are settled: the
  physical philosopher has to deduce the law from the facts. Wait, says the
  judge, until the facts are determined: did the prisoner take the goods
  with felonious intent? did the defendant give what amounts to a warranty?
  or the like. Wait, says Bacon, until all the facts, or all the obtainable
  facts, are brought in: apply my rules of separation to the facts, and the
  result shall come out as easily as by ruler and compasses. We think it
  possible that Harvey might allude to the legal character of Bacon's
  notions: we can hardly conceive so acute a man, after seeing what manner
  of writer Bacon was, meaning only that he was a lawyer and had better
  stick to his business. We do ourselves believe that Bacon's philosophy
  <!-- Page 80 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page80"></a>[80]</span>more resembles the action of mind of a
  common-law judge&mdash;not a Chancellor&mdash;than that of the physical
  inquirers who have been supposed to follow in his steps. It seems to us
  that Bacon's argument is, there can be nothing of law but what must be
  either perceptible, or mechanically deducible, when all the results of
  law, as exhibited in phenomena, are before us. Now the truth is, that the
  physical philosopher has frequently to conceive law which never was in
  his previous thought&mdash;to educe the unknown, not to choose among the
  known. Physical discovery would be very easy work if the inquirer could
  lay down his this, his that, and his t'other, and say, "Now, one of these
  it must be; let us proceed to try which." Often has he done this, and
  failed; often has the truth turned out to be neither this, that, nor
  t'other. Bacon seems to us to think that the philosopher is a judge who
  has to choose, upon ascertained facts, which of known statutes is to rule
  the decision: he appears to us more like a person who is to write the
  statute-book, with no guide except the cases and decisions presented in
  all their confusion and all their conflict.</p>

  <p>Let us take the well-known first aphorism of the <i>Novum
  Organum</i>:</p>

  <p>"Man being the servant and interpreter of nature, can do and
  understand so much, and so much only, as he has observed in fact or in
  thought of the course of nature: beyond this he neither knows anything
  nor can do anything."</p>

  <p>This aphorism is placed by Sir John Herschel<a name="NtA_119"
  href="#Nt_119"><sup>[119]</sup></a> at the head of his <i>Discourse on
  the Study of Natural Philosophy</i>: a book containing notions of
  discovery far beyond any of which Bacon ever dreamed; and this because it
  was written <!-- Page 81 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page81"></a>[81]</span>after discovery, instead of before. Sir John
  Herschel, in his version, has avoided the translation of <i>re vel mente
  observaverit</i>, and gives us only "by his observation of the order of
  nature." In making this the opening of an excellent sermon, he has
  imitated the theologians, who often employ the whole time of the
  discourse in stuffing matter into the text, instead of drawing matter out
  of it. By <i>observation</i> he (Herschel) means the whole course of
  discovery, observation, hypothesis, deduction, comparison, etc. The type
  of the Baconian philosopher as it stood in his mind, had been derived
  from a noble example, his own father, William Herschel,<a name="NtA_120"
  href="#Nt_120"><sup>[120]</sup></a> an inquirer whose processes would
  have been held by Bacon to have been vague, insufficient, compounded of
  chance work and sagacity, and too meagre of facts to deserve the name of
  induction. In another work, his treatise on Astronomy,<a name="NtA_121"
  href="#Nt_121"><sup>[121]</sup></a> Sir John Herschel, after noting that
  a popular account can only place the reader on the threshold, proceeds to
  speak as follows of all the higher departments of science. The italics
  are his own:</p>

  <p>"Admission to its sanctuary, and to the privileges and feelings of a
  votary, is only to be gained by one means&mdash;<i>sound and sufficient
  knowledge of mathematics, the great instrument of all exact inquiry,
  without which no man can ever make such advances in this or any other of
  the higher departments of science as can entitle him to form an
  independent opinion on any subject of discussion within their
  range</i>."</p>

  <p>How is this? Man can know no more than he gets from observation, and
  yet mathematics is the great instrument of all exact inquiry. Are the
  results of mathematical deduction results of observation? We think it
  likely that <!-- Page 82 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page82"></a>[82]</span>Sir John Herschel would reply that Bacon, in
  coupling together <i>observare re</i> and <i>observare mente</i>, has
  done what some wags said Newton afterwards did in his
  study-door&mdash;cut a large hole of exit for the large cat, and a little
  hole for the little cat.<a name="NtA_122"
  href="#Nt_122"><sup>[122]</sup></a> But Bacon did no such thing: he never
  included any deduction under observation. To mathematics he had a
  dislike. He averred that logic and mathematics should be the handmaids,
  not the mistresses, of philosophy. He meant that they should play a
  subordinate and subsequent part in the dressing of the vast mass of facts
  by which discovery was to be rendered equally accessible to Newton and to
  us. Bacon himself was very ignorant of all that had been done by
  mathematics; and, strange to say, he especially objected to astronomy
  being handed over to the mathematicians. Leverrier and Adams, calculating
  an unknown planet into visible existence by enormous heaps of algebra,
  furnish the last comment of note on this specimen of the goodness of
  Bacon's views. The following account of his knowledge of what had been
  done in his own day or before it, is Mr. Spedding's collection of casual
  remarks in Mr. Ellis's several prefaces:</p>

  <p>"Though he paid great attention to astronomy, discussed carefully the
  methods in which it ought to be studied, constructed for the satisfaction
  of his own mind an elaborate theory of the heavens, and listened eagerly
  for the news from the stars brought by Galileo's telescope, he appears to
  have been utterly ignorant of the discoveries which had just been made by
  Kepler's calculations. Though he complained in 1623 of the want of
  compendious methods for facilitating arithmetical computations,
  especially with regard to the doctrine of Series, and fully recognized
  the importance of them as an aid to physical inquiries&mdash;he does not
  say a word about Napier's Logarithms, which had been published only nine
  years before and reprinted more than once in the <!-- Page 83 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page83"></a>[83]</span>interval. He complained
  that no considerable advance had made in geometry beyond Euclid, without
  taking any notice of what had been done by Archimedes and Apollonius. He
  saw the importance of determining accurately the specific gravity of
  different substances, and himself attempted to form a table of them by a
  rude process of his own, without knowing of the more scientific though
  still imperfect methods previously employed by Archimedes, Ghetaldus,<a
  name="NtA_123" href="#Nt_123"><sup>[123]</sup></a> and Porta. He speaks
  of the <span title="heurêka" class="grk"
  >&epsilon;&#x1F55;&rho;&eta;&kappa;&alpha;</span> of Archimedes in a
  manner which implies that he did not clearly apprehend either the nature
  of the problem to be solved or the principles upon which the solution
  depended. In reviewing the progress of mechanics, he makes no mention of
  Archimedes himself, or of Stevinus,<a name="NtA_124"
  href="#Nt_124"><sup>[124]</sup></a> Galileo, Guldinus,<a name="NtA_125"
  href="#Nt_125"><sup>[125]</sup></a> or Ghetaldus. He makes no allusion to
  the theory of equilibrium. He observes that a ball of one pound weight
  will fall nearly as fast through the air as a ball of two, without
  alluding to the theory of the acceleration of falling bodies, which had
  been made known by Galileo more than thirty years before. He proposes an
  inquiry with regard to the lever&mdash;namely, whether in a balance with
  arms of different length but equal weight the distance from the fulcrum
  has any effect upon the inclination,&mdash;though the theory of the lever
  was as well understood in his own time as it is now. In making an
  experiment <!-- Page 84 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page84"></a>[84]</span>of his own to ascertain the cause of the
  motion of a windmill, he overlooks an obvious circumstance which makes
  the experiment inconclusive, and an equally obvious variation of the same
  experiment which would have shown him that his theory was false. He
  speaks of the poles of the earth as fixed, in a manner which seems to
  imply that he was not acquainted with the precession of the equinoxes;
  and in another place, of the north pole being above and the south pole
  below, as a reason why in our hemisphere the north winds predominate over
  the south."</p>

  <p>Much of this was known before, but such a summary of Bacon's want of
  knowledge of the science of his own time was never yet collected in one
  place. We may add, that Bacon seems to have been as ignorant of
  Wright's<a name="NtA_126" href="#Nt_126"><sup>[126]</sup></a> memorable
  addition to the resources of navigation as of Napier's addition to the
  means of calculation. Mathematics was beginning to be the great
  instrument of exact inquiry: Bacon threw the science aside, from
  ignorance, just at the time when his enormous sagacity, applied to
  knowledge, would have made him see the part it was to play. If Newton had
  taken Bacon for his master, not he, but somebody else, would have been
  Newton.<a name="NtA_127" href="#Nt_127"><sup>[127]</sup></a></p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="cenhead">ON METEOROLOGICAL OBSERVATORIES.</p>

  <p>There is an attempt at induction going on, which has yielded little or
  no fruit, the observations made in the meteorological observatories. This
  attempt is carried on in a manner which would have caused Bacon to dance
  for joy; for he lived in times when Chancellors did dance. <!-- Page 85
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page85"></a>[85]</span>Russia, says M.
  Biot,<a name="NtA_128" href="#Nt_128"><sup>[128]</sup></a> is covered by
  an army of meteorographs, with generals, high officers, subalterns, and
  privates with fixed and defined duties of observation. Other countries
  have also their systematic observations. And what has come of it?
  Nothing, says M. Biot, and nothing will ever come of it; the veteran
  mathematician and experimental philosopher declares, as does Mr. Ellis,
  that no single branch of science has ever been fruitfully explored in
  this way. There is no <i>special object</i>, he says. Any one would
  suppose that M. Biot's opinion, given to the French Government upon the
  proposal to construct meteorological observatories in Algeria (<i>Comptes
  Rendus</i>, vol. xli, Dec. 31, 1855), was written to support the mythical
  Bacon, modern physics, against the real Bacon of the <i>Novum
  Organum</i>. There is no <i>special object</i>. In these words lies the
  difference between the two methods.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>[In the report to the Greenwich Board of Visitors for 1867 Mr. Airy,<a
  name="NtA_129" href="#Nt_129"><sup>[129]</sup></a> speaking of the
  increase of meteorological observatories, remarks, "Whether the effect of
  this movement will be that millions of useless observations will be added
  to the millions that already exist, or whether something may be expected
  to result which will lead to a meteorological theory, I cannot hazard a
  conjecture." This <i>is</i> a conjecture, and a very obvious one: if Mr.
  Airy would have given 2-3/4<i>d.</i> for the chance of a meteorological
  theory formed by masses of observations, he would never have said what I
  have quoted.]</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="cenhead">BASIS OF MODERN DISCOVERY.</p>

  <p>Modern discoveries have not been made by large collections of facts,
  with subsequent discussion, separation, and <!-- Page 86 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page86"></a>[86]</span>resulting deduction of a
  truth thus rendered perceptible. A few facts have suggested an
  <i>hypothesis</i>, which means a <i>supposition</i>, proper to explain
  them. The necessary results of this supposition are worked out, and then,
  and not till then, other facts are examined to see if these ulterior
  results are found in nature. The trial of the hypothesis is the
  <i>special object</i>: prior to which, hypothesis must have been started,
  not by rule, but by that sagacity of which no description can be given,
  precisely because the very owners of it do not act under laws perceptible
  to themselves.<a name="NtA_130" href="#Nt_130"><sup>[130]</sup></a> The
  inventor of hypothesis, if pressed to explain his method, must answer as
  did Zerah Colburn,<a name="NtA_131" href="#Nt_131"><sup>[131]</sup></a>
  when asked for his mode of instantaneous calculation. When the poor boy
  had been bothered for some time in this manner, he cried out in a huff,
  "God put it into my head, and I can't put it into yours."<a
  name="NtA_132" href="#Nt_132"><sup>[132]</sup></a> <!-- Page 87 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page87"></a>[87]</span>Wrong hypotheses, rightly
  worked from, have produced more useful results than unguided observation.
  But this is not the Baconian plan. Charles the Second, when informed of
  the state of navigation, founded a Baconian observatory at Greenwich, to
  observe, observe, observe away at the moon, until her motions were known
  sufficiently well to render her useful in guiding the seaman. And no
  doubt Flamsteed's<a name="NtA_133" href="#Nt_133"><sup>[133]</sup></a>
  observations, twenty or thirty of them at least, were of signal use. But
  how? A somewhat fanciful thinker, one Kepler, had hit upon the
  approximate orbits of the planets by trying one hypothesis after another:
  he found the <i>ellipse</i>, which the Platonists, well despised of
  Bacon, and who would have despised him as heartily if they had known him,
  had investigated and put ready to hand nearly 2000 years before.<a
  name="NtA_134" href="#Nt_134"><sup>[134]</sup></a> The sun in the focus,
  the motions of the planet more and more rapid as they approach the sun,
  led Kepler&mdash;and Bacon would have reproved him for his
  rashness&mdash;to imagine that a force residing in the sun might move the
  planets, a force inversely as the distance. Bouillaud,<a name="NtA_135"
  href="#Nt_135"><sup>[135]</sup></a> upon a fanciful analogy, rejected the
  inverse distance, <!-- Page 88 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page88"></a>[88]</span>and, rejecting the force altogether,
  declared that if such a thing there were, it would be as the inverse
  <i>square</i> of the distance. Newton, ready prepared with the
  mathematics of the subject, tried the fall of the moon towards the earth,
  away from her tangent, and found that, as compared with the fall of a
  stone, the law of the inverse square did hold for the moon. He deduced
  the ellipse, he proceeded to deduce the effect of the disturbance of the
  sun upon the moon, upon the assumed theory of <i>universal</i>
  gravitation. He found result after result of his theory in conformity
  with observed fact: and, by aid of Flamsteed's observations, which
  amended what mathematicians call his <i>constants</i>, he constructed his
  lunar theory. Had it not been for Newton, the whole dynasty of Greenwich
  astronomers, from Flamsteed of happy memory, to Airy whom Heaven
  preserve,<a name="NtA_136" href="#Nt_136"><sup>[136]</sup></a> might have
  worked away at nightly observation and daily reduction, without any
  remarkable result: looking forward, as to a millennium, to the time when
  any man of moderate intelligence was to see the whole explanation. What
  are large collections of facts for? To make theories <i>from</i>, says
  Bacon: to try ready-made theories <i>by</i>, says the history of
  discovery: it's all the same, says the idolater: nonsense, say we!</p>

  <p>Time and space run short: how odd it is that of the three leading
  ideas of mechanics, time, space, and matter, the first two should always
  fail a reviewer before the third. We might dwell upon many points,
  especially if we attempted a more descriptive account of the valuable
  edition before us. No one need imagine that the editors, by their
  uncompromising attack upon the notion of Bacon's influence common even
  among mathematicians and experimental philosophers, have lowered the
  glory of the great man whom it was, many will think, their business to
  defend through thick and thin. They have given a clearer notion of his
  <!-- Page 89 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page89"></a>[89]</span>excellencies, and a better idea of the power
  of his mind, than ever we saw given before. Such a correction as theirs
  must have come, and soon, for as Hallam says&mdash;after noting that the
  <i>Novum Organum</i> was <i>never published separately in England</i>,
  Bacon has probably been more read in the last thirty years&mdash;now
  forty&mdash;than in the two hundred years which preceded. He will now be
  more read than ever he was. The history of the intellectual world is the
  history of the worship of one idol after another. No sooner is it clear
  that a Hercules has appeared among men, than all that imagination can
  conceive of strength is attributed to him, and his labors are recorded in
  the heavens. The time arrives when, as in the case of Aristotle, a new
  deity is found, and the old one is consigned to shame and reproach. A
  reaction may afterwards take place, and this is now happening in the case
  of the Greek philosopher. The end of the process is, that the opposing
  deities take their places, side by side, in a Pantheon dedicated not to
  gods, but to heroes.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="cenhead">THE REAL VALUE OF BACON'S WORKS.</p>

  <p>Passing over the success of Bacon's own endeavors to improve the
  details of physical science, which was next to nothing, and of his method
  as a whole, which has never been practised, we might say much of the good
  influence of his writings. Sound wisdom, set in sparkling wit, must
  instruct and amuse to the end of time: and, as against error, we repeat
  that Bacon is soundly wise, so far as he goes. There is hardly a form of
  human error within his scope which he did not detect, expose, and attach
  to a satirical metaphor which never ceases to sting. He is largely
  indebted to a very extensive reading; but the thoughts of others fall
  into his text with such a close-fitting compactness that he can make even
  the words of the Sacred Writers pass for his own. A saying of the prophet
  Daniel, rather a hackneyed quotation in our day, <i>Multi pertransibunt,
  et augebitur scientia</i>, stands in the title-page of the first edition
  <!-- Page 90 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page90"></a>[90]</span>of
  Montucla's <i>History of Mathematics</i> as a quotation from
  Bacon&mdash;and it is not the only place in which this mistake occurs.
  When the truth of the matter, as to Bacon's system, is fully recognized,
  we have little fear that there will be a reaction against the man. First,
  because Bacon will always live to speak for himself, for he will not
  cease to be read: secondly, because those who seek the truth will find it
  in the best edition of his works, and will be most ably led to know what
  Bacon was, in the very books which first showed at large what he <i>was
  not</i>.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="cenhead">THE CONGREGATION OF THE INDEX, ON COPERNICUS.</p>

  <p>In this year (1620) appeared the corrections under which the
  Congregation of the Index&mdash;i.e., the Committee of Cardinals which
  superintended the <i>Index</i> of forbidden books&mdash;proposed to allow
  the work of Copernicus to be read. I insert these conditions in full,
  because they are often alluded to, and I know of no source of reference
  accessible to a twentieth part of those who take interest in the
  question.</p>

  <p>By a decree of the Congregation of the Index, dated March 5, 1616, the
  work of Copernicus, and another of Didacus Astunica,<a name="NtA_137"

  indeed had been 17 years out of <!-- Page 96 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  an excellent joke. It is obvious that the Cardinals of the Index were a
  little ashamed of their position, and made a mere excuse of a few
  corrections. Their mode of dealing with chap. 8, this <i>problematice
  videtur loqui, ut studiosis satisfiat</i>,<a name="NtA_156"

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="cenhead">THE CONVOCATION AT OXFORD EQUALLY AT FAULT.</p>

  <p>1622. I make no reference to the case of Galileo, except this. I have
  pointed out (<i>Penny Cycl. Suppl.</i> "Galileo"; <i>Engl. Cycl.</i>
  "Motion of the Earth") that it is clear the absurdity was the act of the
  <i>Italian</i> Inquisition&mdash;for the private and personal pleasure of
  the Pope, who <i>knew</i> that the course he took would not commit him as
  <i>Pope</i>&mdash;and not of the body which calls itself the
  <i>Church</i>. Let the dirty proceeding have its right name. The Jesuit
  Riccioli,<a name="NtA_158" href="#Nt_158"><sup>[158]</sup></a> the
  stoutest and most learned Anti-Copernican in Europe, and the Puritan
  Wilkins, a strong Copernican and Pope-hater, are equally positive that
  the Roman <i>Church</i> never pronounced any decision: and this in the
  time immediately following the ridiculous proceeding of the Inquisition.
  In like manner a decision of the Convocation of Oxford is not a law of
  the <i>English</i> Church; which is fortunate, for that Convocation, in
  1622, came to a decision quite as absurd, and a great deal <!-- Page 97
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page97"></a>[97]</span>more wicked than
  the declaration against the motion of the earth. The second was a foolish
  mistake; the first was a disgusting surrender of right feeling. The story
  is told without disapprobation by Anthony Wood, who never exaggerated
  anything against the university of which he is writing eulogistic
  history.</p>

  <p>In 1622, one William Knight<a name="NtA_159"
  href="#Nt_159"><sup>[159]</sup></a> put forward in a sermon preached
  before the University certain theses which, looking at the state of the
  times, may have been improper and possibly of seditious intent. One of
  them was that the bishop might excommunicate the civil magistrate: this
  proposition the clerical body could not approve, and designated it by the
  term <i>erronea</i>,<a name="NtA_160" href="#Nt_160"><sup>[160]</sup></a>
  the mildest going. But Knight also declared as follows:</p>

  <p>"Subditis mere privatis, si Tyrannus tanquam latro aut stuprator in
  ipsos faciat impetum, et ipsi nec potestatem ordinariam implorare, nec
  alia ratione effugere periculum possint, in presenti periculo se et suos
  contra tyrannum, sicut contra privatum grassatorem, defendere licet."<a
  name="NtA_161" href="#Nt_161"><sup>[161]</sup></a></p>

  <p>That is, a man may defend his purse or a woman her honor, against the
  personal attack of a king, as against that of a private person, if no
  other means of safety can be found. The Convocation sent Knight to
  prison, declared the proposition <i>"falsa</i>, periculosa, et
  <i>impia</i>," and enacted that all applicants for degrees should
  subscribe this censure, and make oath that they would neither hold,
  teach, nor defend Knight's opinions.</p>

  <p>The thesis, in the form given, was unnecessary and improper. Though
  strong opinions of the king's rights were advanced at the time, yet no
  one ventured to say that, <!-- Page 98 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page98"></a>[98]</span>ministers and advisers apart, the king might
  <i>personally</i> break the law; and we know that the first and only
  attempt which his successor made brought on the crisis which cost him his
  throne and his head. But the declaration that the proposition was
  <i>false</i> far exceeds in all that is disreputable the decision of the
  Inquisition against the earth's motion. We do not mention this little
  matter in England. Knight was a Puritan, and Neal<a name="NtA_162"
  href="#Nt_162"><sup>[162]</sup></a> gives a short account of his sermon.
  From comparison with Wood,<a name="NtA_163"
  href="#Nt_163"><sup>[163]</sup></a> I judge that the theses, as given,
  were not Knight's words, but the digest which it was customary to make in
  criminal proceedings against opinion. This heightens the joke, for it
  appears that the qualifiers of the Convocation took pains to present
  their condemnation of Knight in the terms which would most unequivocally
  make their censure condemn themselves. This proceeding took place in the
  interval between the two proceedings against Galileo: it is left
  undetermined whether we must say pot-kettle-pot or kettle-pot-kettle.</p>

  what number of such bodies there are, so many organisms may there be, of
  which we have no way of thinking nor of speaking. This is seldom

  Of every one of their systems I say, as the Irish Bishop said of

  Huyghens is very fanciful and very positive; but he gives a true account
  of his method. "But since there's no hopes of a Mercury to carry us such
  a journey, we shall e'en be contented with what's in our power: we shall
  suppose ourselves there...." And yet he says, "We have proved that they
  live in societies, have hands and feet...." Kircher<a name="NtA_181"

  falsehood, in which the choice is a matter of importance. My work

  <p>The great circulating mediums, who wrote to everybody, heard from
  everybody, and sent extracts to everybody else, have been Father
  Mersenne, John Collins, and the late Professor Schumacher: all "late" no
  doubt, but only the last recent enough to be so styled. If M.C.S. should
  ever again stand for "Member of the Corresponding Society," it should
  raise an acrostic thought of the three. There is an allusion to
  Mersenne's occupation in Hobbes's reply to him. He wanted to give Hobbes,
  who was very ill at Paris, the Roman Eucharist: but Hobbes said, "I have
  settled all that long ago; when did you hear from Gassendi?" We are
  reminded of William's answer to Burnet. John Collins disseminated Newton,
  among others. Schumacher ought to have been called the postmaster-general
  of astronomy, as Collins was called the attorney-general of

<p class="cenhead">AN ESTIMATE OF SCALIGER.</p>

  <p>Scaliger inspired some mathematicians with great respect for his
  geometrical knowledge. Vieta, the first man of his time, who answered
  him, had such regard for his opponent <!-- Page 111 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page111"></a>[111]</span>as made him conceal
  Scaliger's name. Not that he is very respectful in his manner of
  proceeding: the following dry quiz on his opponent's logic must have been
  very cutting, being true. "In grammaticis, dare navibus Austros, et dare
  naves Austris, sunt æque significantia. Sed in Geometricis, aliud est

  that, he and another paying a visit to Vieta, the conversation fell upon
  Scaliger, of whom the host said that he believed Scaliger was the only
  man who perfectly understood mathematical writers, especially the Greek
  ones: and that he thought more of Scaliger when wrong than of many others
  when right; "pluris se Scaligerum vel errantem facere quam multos <span

  before Scaliger's quadrature (1594). There is an old story of some one
  saying, "Mallem cum Scaligero errare, quam cum Clavio recte sapere."<a
  name="NtA_209" href="#Nt_209"><sup>[209]</sup></a> This I cannot help
  suspecting to have been a version of Vieta's speech with Clavius
  satirically inserted, on account of the great hostility which Vieta
  showed towards Clavius in the latter years of his life.</p>

  <p>Montucla could not have read with care either Scaliger's quadrature or
  Clavius's refutation. He gives the first a wrong date: he assures the
  world that there is no question about Scaliger's quadrature being wrong,
  in the eyes of geometers at least: and he states that Clavius mortified
  him <!-- Page 112 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page112"></a>[112]</span>extremely by showing that it made the
  circle less than its inscribed dodecagon, which is, of course, equivalent
  to asserting that a straight line is not always the shortest distance
  between two points. Did <i>Clavius</i> show this? No, it was Scaliger
  himself who showed it, boasted of it, and declared it to be a "noble
  paradox" that a theorem false in geometry is true in arithmetic; a thing,
  he says with great triumph, not noticed by Archimedes himself! He says in
  so many words that the periphery of the dodecagon is greater than that of
  the circle; and that the more sides there are to the inscribed figure,
  the more does it exceed the circle in which it is. And here <i>are</i>
  the words, on the independent testimonies of Clavius and Kastner:</p>

  <p>"Ambitus dodecagoni circulo inscribendi plus potest quam circuli
  ambitus. Et quanto deinceps plurium laterum fuerit polygonum circulo
  inscribendum, tanto plus poterit ambitus polygoni quam ambitus
  circuli."<a name="NtA_210" href="#Nt_210"><sup>[210]</sup></a></p>

  <p>There is much resemblance between Joseph Scaliger and William
  Hamilton,<a name="NtA_211" href="#Nt_211"><sup>[211]</sup></a> in a
  certain impetuousity of character, and inaptitude to think of quantity.
  Scaliger maintained that the arc of a circle is less than its chord in
  arithmetic, though greater in geometry; Hamilton arrived at two
  quantities which are identical, but the greater the one the less the
  other. But, on the whole, I liken Hamilton rather to Julius than to
  Joseph. On this last hero of literature I repeat Thomas Edwards,<a

  unlearned who, be his other knowledge what it may, does not <!-- Page 113

  subject he writes about. And now one of many instances in which
  literature gives to literature character in science. Anthony Teissier,<a

  of De Thou's biographies, says of Finæus, "Il se vanta sans raison avoir

  <p>Natural and Political Observations ... upon the Bills of Mortality. By
  John Graunt, citizen of London. London, 1662, 4to.<a name="NtA_215"

  <p>This is a celebrated book, the first great work upon mortality. But
  the author, going <i>ultra crepidam</i>, has attributed to the motion of
  the moon in her orbit all the tremors which she gets from a shaky
  telescope.<a name="NtA_216" href="#Nt_216"><sup>[216]</sup></a> But there
  is another paradox about this book: the above absurd opinion is
  attributed to that excellent mechanist, Sir William Petty, who passed his
  days among the astronomers. Graunt did not write his own book! Anthony
  Wood<a name="NtA_217" href="#Nt_217"><sup>[217]</sup></a> hints that
  Petty "assisted, or put into a way" his old benefactor: no doubt the two
  friends talked the matter over many a time. Burnet and Pepys<a
  name="NtA_218" href="#Nt_218"><sup>[218]</sup></a> state that Petty wrote
  the book. It is enough for me that <!-- Page 114 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page114"></a>[114]</span>Graunt, whose honesty
  was never impeached, uses the plainest incidental professions of
  authorship throughout; that he was elected into the Royal Society because
  he was the author; that Petty refers to him as author in scores of
  places, and published an edition, as editor, after Graunt's death, with
  Graunt's name of course. The note on Graunt in the <i>Biographia
  Britannica</i> may be consulted; it seems to me decisive. Mr. C.&nbsp;B.
  Hodge, an able actuary, has done the best that can be done on the other
  side in the <i>Assurance Magazine</i>, viii. 234. If I may say what is in
  my mind, without imputation of disrespect, I suspect some actuaries have
  a bias: they would rather have Petty the greater for their Coryphæus than
  Graunt the less.<a name="NtA_219" href="#Nt_219"><sup>[219]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Pepys is an ordinary gossip: but Burnet's account has an animus which
  is of a worse kind. He talks of "one Graunt, a Papist, under whose name
  Sir William Petty<a name="NtA_220" href="#Nt_220"><sup>[220]</sup></a>
  published his observations on the bills of mortality." He then gives the
  cock without a bull story of Graunt being a trustee of the New River
  Company, and shutting up the cocks and carrying off their keys, just
  before the fire of London, by which a supply of water was delayed.<a
  name="NtA_221" href="#Nt_221"><sup>[221]</sup></a> It was one of the
  first objections made to Burnet's work, that Graunt was <i>not</i> a
  trustee at the time; and Maitland, the historian of London, ascertained
  from the books of the Company that he was not admitted until twenty-three
  days after the breaking out of the fire. Graunt's first admission <!--
  Page 115 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page115"></a>[115]</span>to
  the Company took place on the very day on which a committee was appointed
  to inquire into the cause of the fire. So much for Burnet. I incline to
  the view that Graunt's setting London on fire strongly corroborates his
  having written on the bills of mortality: every practical man takes stock
  before he commences a grand operation in business.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>If this book had been a fair specimen, I might have pointed to it in
  connection with contemporary English works, and made a scornful
  comparison. But it is not a fair specimen. Beaulieu was attached to the
  Royal Household, and throughout the century it may be suspected that the
  household forced a royal road to geometry. Fifty years before, Beaugrand,
  the king's secretary, made a fool of himself, and [so?] contrived to pass
  for a geometer. He had interest enough to get Desargues, the most
  powerful geometer of his time,<a name="NtA_233"
  href="#Nt_233"><sup>[233]</sup></a> the teacher and friend of Pascal,
  prohibited from <!-- Page 120 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page120"></a>[120]</span>lecturing. See some letters on the History
  of Perspective, which I wrote in the <i>Athenæum</i>, in October and
  November, 1861. Montucla, who does not seem to know the true secret of
  Beaugrand's greatness, describes him as "un certain M. de Beaugrand,
  mathématicien, fort mal traité par Descartes, et à ce qu'il paroit avec
  justice."<a name="NtA_234" href="#Nt_234"><sup>[234]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Beaulieu's quadrature amounts to a geometrical construction<a
  name="NtA_235" href="#Nt_235"><sup>[235]</sup></a> which gives <span
  class="grk">&pi;</span> = &radic;10. His depth may be ascertained from
  the following extracts. First on Copernicus:</p>

  <p>"Copernic, Allemand, ne s'est pas moins rendu illustre par ses doctes
  écrits; et nous pourrions dire de luy, qu'il seroit le seul et unique en
  la force de ses Problèmes, si sa trop grande présomption ne l'avoit porté
  à avancer en cette Science une proposition aussi absurde, qu'elle est
  contre la Foy et raison, en faisant la circonférence d'un Cercle fixe,

  avancé en son Traitté Astrologique le Soleil fixe, et la Terre mobile."<a
  name="NtA_236" href="#Nt_236"><sup>[236]</sup></a></p>

  <p>I digress here to point out that though our quadrators, etc., very
  often, and our historians sometimes, assert that men of the character of
  Copernicus, etc., were treated with contempt and abuse until their day of
  ascendancy came, nothing can be more incorrect. From Tycho Brahé<a
  name="NtA_237" href="#Nt_237"><sup>[237]</sup></a> to Beaulieu, there is
  but one expression of admiration for the genius of Copernicus. There is
  an exception, which, I <!-- Page 121 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  the safety with which various authors may be read after his cautions,
  says, "Toleratur et Nicolaus Copernicus qui Solem fixum et Terram <i>in
  girum circumverti</i> posuit: et scutica potius, aut flagello, quam
  reprehensione dignus est."<a name="NtA_239"
  href="#Nt_239"><sup>[239]</sup></a> Maurolycus was a mild and somewhat

  himself held very high stations in the household all his life, could have
  given people the notion that when such an officer chose to declare
  himself an algebraist, he must be one indeed? This would explain
  Beaugrand, Beaulieu, and all the <i>beaux</i>. Beaugrand&mdash;not only
  secretary to the king, but "mathematician" to the Duke of Orleans&mdash;I

  <p>This is another tract of Chief Justice Hale, published the year after
  his death. The reader will remember that <i>motion</i>, in old
  philosophy, meant any change from state to state: what we now describe as
  <i>motion</i> was <i>local motion</i>. This is a very philosophical book,
  about <i>flux</i> and <i>materia prima</i>, <i>virtus activa</i> and
  <i>essentialis</i>, and other fundamentals. I think Stephen Hales, the
  author of the "Vegetable Statics," has the writings of the Chief Justice
  sometimes attributed to him, which is very puny justice indeed.<a
  name="NtA_244" href="#Nt_244"><sup>[244]</sup></a> Matthew Hale died in
  1676, and from his devotion to science it probably arose that his famous
  <i>Pleas of the Crown</i><a name="NtA_245"
  href="#Nt_245"><sup>[245]</sup></a> and other law works did not appear
  until after his death. One of his <!-- Page 124 --><span

  astronomer Thomas Street, whose <i>Caroline Tables</i><a name="NtA_246"

  href="#Nt_247"><sup>[247]</sup></a> But of the astronomer absolutely
  nothing is known: it is very unlikely that he and the judge were the same
  person, but there is not a bit of positive evidence either for or
  against, so far as can be ascertained. Halley<a name="NtA_248"
  href="#Nt_248"><sup>[248]</sup></a>&mdash;no less a
  person&mdash;published two editions of the <i>Caroline Tables</i>, no
  doubt after the death of the author: strange indeed that neither Halley
  nor any one else should leave evidence that Street was born or died.</p>

  <p>Matthew Hale gave rise to an instance of the lengths a lawyer will go

</blockquote>

  <p>This is a celebrated speculation, and has been reprinted abroad, and
  seriously answered. Craig is known in the early history of fluxions, and
  was a good mathematician. <!-- Page 130 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page130"></a>[130]</span>He professed to calculate, on the
  hypothesis that the suspicions against historical evidence increase with
  the square of the time, how long it will take the evidence of
  Christianity to die out. He finds, by formulæ, that had it been oral
  only, it would have gone out A.D. 800; but, by aid of the written
  evidence, it will last till A.D. 3150. At this period he places the
  second coming, which is deferred until the extinction of evidence, on the
  authority of the question "When the Son of Man cometh, shall he find
  faith on the earth?" It is a pity that Craig's theory was not adopted: it
  would have spared a hundred treatises on the end of the world, founded on
  no better knowledge than his, and many of them falsified by the event.
  The most recent (October, 1863) is a tract in proof of Louis Napoleon
  being Antichrist, the Beast, the eighth Head, etc.; and the present
  dispensation is to close soon after 1864.</p>

  <p>In order rightly to judge Craig, who added speculations on the
  variations of pleasure and pain treated as functions of time, it is
  necessary to remember that in Newton's day the idea of force, as a
  quantity to be measured, and as following a law of variation, was very
  new: so likewise was that of probability, or belief, as an object of
  measurement.<a name="NtA_269" href="#Nt_269"><sup>[269]</sup></a> The
  success of the <i>Principia</i> of Newton put it into many heads to
  speculate about applying notions of quantity to other things not then
  brought under measurement. Craig imitated Newton's title, and evidently
  thought he was making a step in advance: but it is not every one who can
  plough with Samson's heifer.</p>

  <p>It is likely enough that Craig took a hint, directly or indirectly,
  from Mohammedan writers, who make a reply to the argument that the Koran
  has not the evidence derived <!-- Page 131 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page131"></a>[131]</span>from miracles. They say that, as evidence
  of Christian miracles is daily becoming weaker, a time must at last
  arrive when it will fail of affording assurance that they were miracles
  at all: whence would arise the necessity of another prophet and other
  miracles. Lee,<a name="NtA_270" href="#Nt_270"><sup>[270]</sup></a> the
  Cambridge Orientalist, from whom the above words are taken, almost
  certainly never heard of Craig or his theory.</p>

  <p>This is the celebrated tract, written by the two Arian heretics.
  Swift, whose orthodoxy was as undoubted as his meekness, wrote upon it
  the epigram&mdash;if, indeed, that be epigram of which the point is pious
  wish&mdash;which has been so often recited for the purity of its style, a
  purity which transcends modern printing. Perhaps some readers may think
  that Swift cared little for Whiston and Ditton, except as a chance
  hearing of their plan pointed them out as good marks. But it was not so:
  the clique had their eye on the guilty pair before the publication of the
  tract. The preface is dated July 7; and ten days afterwards Arbuthnot<a
  name="NtA_278" href="#Nt_278"><sup>[278]</sup></a> writes as follows to
  Swift:</p>

  <p>"Whiston has at last published his project of the longitude; the most
  ridiculous thing that ever was thought on. But a pox on him! he has
  spoiled one of my papers of Scriblerus, which was a proposition for the
  longitude not very unlike his, to this purpose; that since there was no
  pole for east and west, that all the princes of Europe should join and
  build two prodigious poles, upon high mountains, <!-- Page 134 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page134"></a>[134]</span>with a vast lighthouse
  to serve for a polestar. I was thinking of a calculation of the time,
  charges, and dimensions. Now you must understand his project is by
  lighthouses, and explosion of bombs at a certain hour."</p>

  <p>The plan was certainly impracticable; but Whiston and Ditton might
  have retorted that they were nearer to the longitude than their satirist
  to the kingdom of heaven, or even to a bishopric. Arbuthnot, I think,
  here and elsewhere, reveals himself as the calculator who kept Swift
  right in his proportions in the matter of the Lilliputians,
  Brobdingnagians, etc. Swift was very ignorant about things connected with
  number. He writes to Stella that he has discovered that leap-year comes
  every four years, and that all his life he had thought it came every
  three years. Did he begin with the mistake of Cæsar's priests? Whether or
  no, when I find the person who did not understand leap-year inventing
  satellites of Mars in correct accordance with Kepler's third law, I feel
  sure he must have had help.</p>

  he gives a quadrature.<a name="NtA_282"
  href="#Nt_282"><sup>[282]</sup></a> He gives the same or another, I do
  not know which, in the present work, in which the circle is 3-1/5
  diameters. This volume is of 981 good folio pages, and treats of all
  things, mental and material. The author is not at all mad, only wrong on
  <!-- Page 136 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page136"></a>[136]</span>many points. It is the weakness of the
  orthodox follower of any received system to impute insanity to the
  solitary dissentient: which is voted (in due time) a very wrong opinion
  about Copernicus, Columbus, or Galileo, but quite right about Robert
  Greene. If misconceptions, acted on by too much self-opinion, be
  sufficient evidence of madness, it would be a curious inquiry what is the
  least per-centage of the reigning school which has been insane at any one
  time. Greene is one of the sources for Newton being led to think of
  gravitation by the fall of an apple: his authority is the gossip of
  Martin Folkes.<a name="NtA_283" href="#Nt_283"><sup>[283]</sup></a>
  Probably Folkes had it from Newton's niece, Mrs. Conduitt, whom Voltaire
  acknowledges as <i>his authority</i>.<a name="NtA_284"
  href="#Nt_284"><sup>[284]</sup></a> It is in the draft found among
  Conduitt's papers of memoranda to be sent to Fontenelle. But Fontenelle,
  though a great retailer of anecdote, does not mention it in his
  <i>éloge</i> of Newton; whence it may be suspected that it was left out
  in the copy forwarded to France. D'Israeli has got an improvement on the
  story: the apple "struck him a smart blow on the head": no doubt taking
  him just on the organ of causality. He was "surprised at the force of the
  stroke" from so small an apple: but then the apple had a mission; Homer
  would have said <!-- Page 137 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page137"></a>[137]</span>it was Minerva in the form of an apple.
  "This led him to consider the accelerating motion of falling bodies,"
  which Galileo had settled long before: "from whence he deduced the
  principle of gravity," which many had considered before him, but no one
  had <i>deduced anything from it</i>. I cannot imagine whence D'Israeli
  got the rap on the head, I mean got it for Newton: this is very unlike
  his usual accounts of things. The story is pleasant and possible: its
  only defect is that various writings, well known to Newton, a very
  <i>learned</i> mathematician, had given more suggestion than a whole sack
  of apples could have done, if they had tumbled on that mighty head all at
  once. And Pemberton, speaking from Newton himself, says nothing more than
  that the idea of the moon being retained by the same force which causes
  the fall of bodies struck him for the first time while meditating in a
  garden. One particular tree at Woolsthorpe has been selected as the
  gallows of the appleshaped goddess: it died in 1820, and Mr. Turnor<a
  name="NtA_285" href="#Nt_285"><sup>[285]</sup></a> kept the wood; but Sir
  D. Brewster<a name="NtA_286" href="#Nt_286"><sup>[286]</sup></a> brought
  away a bit of root in 1814, and must have had it on his conscience for 43
  years that he may have killed the tree. Kepler's suggestion of
  gravitation with the inverse distance, and Bouillaud's proposed
  substitution of the inverse square of the distance, are things which
  Newton knew better than his modern readers. I discovered two anagrams on
  his name, which are quite conclusive; the notion of gravitation was
  <i>not new</i>; but Newton <i>went on</i>. Some wandering spirit,
  probably whose business it was to resent any liberty taken with Newton's
  name, put into the head of a friend of mine <i>eighty-one</i> anagrams on
  my own pair, some of which hit harder than any apple.</p>

  <p>I think I have a right to one little paradox of my own: I greatly
  doubt that Newton wrote this book. Castiglione,<a name="NtA_290"
  href="#Nt_290"><sup>[290]</sup></a> in his <i>Newtoni Opuscula</i>,<a
  name="NtA_291" href="#Nt_291"><sup>[291]</sup></a> gives it in the Latin
  which appeared in 1731,<a name="NtA_292"
  href="#Nt_292"><sup>[292]</sup></a> not for the first time; he says
  <i>Angli omnes Newtono tribuunt</i>.<a name="NtA_293"
  href="#Nt_293"><sup>[293]</sup></a> It appeared just after Newton's
  death, without the name of any editor, or any allusion to Newton's <!--
  Page 140 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page140"></a>[140]</span>recent departure, purporting to be that
  popular treatise which Newton, at the beginning of the third book of the
  <i>Principia</i>, says he wrote, intending it to be the third book. It is
  very possible that some observant turnpenny might construct such a
  treatise as this from the third book, that it might be ready for
  publication the moment Newton could not disown it. It has been treated
  with singular silence: the name of the editor has never been given.
  Rigaud<a name="NtA_294" href="#Nt_294"><sup>[294]</sup></a> mentions it
  without a word: I cannot find it in Brewster's <i>Newton</i>, nor in the
  <i>Biographia Britannica</i>. There is no copy in the Catalogue of the
  Royal Society's Library, either in English or Latin, except in
  Castiglione. I am open to correction; but I think nothing from Newton's
  acknowledged works will prove&mdash;as laid down in the suspected
  work&mdash;that he took Numa's temple of Vesta, with a central fire, to
  be intended to symbolize the sun as the center of our system, in the
  Copernican sense.<a name="NtA_295"
  href="#Nt_295"><sup>[295]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Mr. Edleston<a name="NtA_296" href="#Nt_296"><sup>[296]</sup></a>
  gives an account of the <i>lectures</i> "de motu corporum," and gives the
  corresponding pages of the <i>Latin</i> "De Systemate Mundi" of 1731. But
  no one mentions the <i>English</i> of 1728. This English seems to agree
  with the Latin; but there is a mystery about it. The preface says, "That
  this work as here published is genuine will so clearly appear by the
  intrinsic marks it bears, that it will be but losing words and the
  reader's time to take pains in giving him any other satisfaction." Surely
  fewer words would have been lost if the prefator had said at once that
  the work was from the manuscript preserved at Cambridge. Perhaps it was a
  mangled copy clandestinely taken and interpreted. <!-- Page 141 --><span

<p class="cenhead">A BACONIAN CONTROVERSY.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>Lord Bacon not the author of "The Christian Paradoxes," being a
  reprint of "Memorials of Godliness and Christianity," by Herbert Palmer,
  B.D.<a name="NtA_297" href="#Nt_297"><sup>[297]</sup></a> With
  Introduction, Memoir, and Notes, by the Rev. Alexander B. Grosart,<a
  name="NtA_298" href="#Nt_298"><sup>[298]</sup></a> Kenross. (Private
  circulation, 1864).</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>I insert the above in this place on account of a slight connection
  with the last. Bacon's Paradoxes,&mdash;so attributed&mdash;were first
  published as his in some asserted "Remains," 1648.<a name="NtA_299"
  href="#Nt_299"><sup>[299]</sup></a> They were admitted into his works in
  1730, and remain there to this day. The title is "The Character of a
  believing Christian, set forth in paradoxes and seeming contradictions."
  The following is a specimen:</p>

  <p>"He believes three to be one and one to be three; a father not to be
  older than his son; a son to be equal with his father; and one proceeding
  from both to be equal with both: he believes three persons in one nature,
  and two natures in one person.... He believes the God of all grace to
  have been angry with one that never offended Him; and that God that hates
  sin to be reconciled to himself though sinning continually, and never
  making or being able to make Him any satisfaction. He believes a most
  just God to have punished a most just person, and to have justified
  himself, though a most ungodly sinner. He believes himself freely
  pardoned, and yet a sufficient satisfaction was made for him."</p>

  <p>Who can doubt that if Bacon had written this it must have been wrong?
  Many writers, especially on the <!-- Page 142 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page142"></a>[142]</span>Continent, have taken him as sneering at
  (Athanasian) Christianity right and left. Many Englishmen have taken him
  to be quite in earnest, and to have produced a body of edifying doctrine.
  More than a century ago the Paradoxes were published as a penny tract;
  and, again, at the same price, in the <i>Penny Sunday Reader</i>, vol.
  vi, No. 148, a few passages were omitted, as <i>too strong</i>. But all
  did not agree: in my copy of Peter Shaw's <a name="NtA_300"
  href="#Nt_300"><sup>[300]</sup></a> edition (vol. ii, p. 283) the
  Paradoxes have been cut out by the binder, who has left the backs of the
  leaves. I never had the curiosity to see whether other copies of the
  edition have been served in the same way. The Religious Tract Society
  republished them recently in <i>Selections from the Writings of Lord
  Bacon</i>, (no date; bad plan; about 1863, I suppose). No omissions were
  made, so far as I find.</p>

  <p>I never believed that Bacon wrote this paper; it has neither his
  <i>sparkle</i> nor his idiom. I stated my doubts even before I heard that
  Mr. Spedding, one of Bacon's editors, was of the same mind.
  (<i>Athenæum</i>, July 16, 1864). I was little moved by the wide consent
  of orthodox men: for I knew how Bacon, Milton, Newton, Locke, etc., were
  always claimed as orthodox until almost the present day. Of this there is
  a remarkable instance.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="cenhead">LOCKE AND SOCINIANISM.</p>

  <p>Among the books which in my younger day were in some orthodox
  publication lists&mdash;I think in the list of the Christian Knowledge
  Society, but I am not sure&mdash;was Locke's <a name="NtA_301"
  href="#Nt_301"><sup>[301]</sup></a> "Reasonableness of Christianity." It
  seems to have come down from the eighteenth century, when the battle was
  belief in Christ against unbelief, <i>simpliciter</i>, as the <!-- Page
  143 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page143"></a>[143]</span>logicians
  say. Now, if ever there was a Socinian<a name="NtA_302"
  href="#Nt_302"><sup>[302]</sup></a> book in the world, it is this work of
  Locke. "These two," says Locke, "faith and repentance, i.e., believing
  Jesus to be the Messiah, and a good life, are the indispensable
  conditions of the new covenant, to be performed by all those who would
  obtain eternal life." All the book is amplification of this doctrine.
  Locke, in this and many other things, followed Hobbes, whose doctrine, in
  the Leviathan, is <i>fidem, quanta ad salutem necessaria est, contineri
  in hoc articulo, Jesus est Christus</i>.<a name="NtA_303"
  href="#Nt_303"><sup>[303]</sup></a> For this Hobbes was called an
  atheist, which <!-- Page 144 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page144"></a>[144]</span>many still believe him to have been: some
  of his contemporaries called him, rightly, a Socinian. Locke was known
  for a Socinian as soon as his work appeared: Dr. John Edwards,<a
  name="NtA_304" href="#Nt_304"><sup>[304]</sup></a> his assailant, says he
  is "Socinianized all over." Locke, in his reply, says "there is not one
  word of Socinianism in it:" and he was right: the positive Socinian
  doctrine has <i>not one word of Socinianism in it</i>; Socinianism
  consists in omissions. Locke and Hobbes did not dare <i>deny</i> the
  Trinity: for such a thing Hobbes might have been roasted, and Locke might
  have been strangled. Accordingly, the well-known way of teaching
  Unitarian doctrine was the collection of the asserted essentials of
  Christianity, without naming the Trinity, etc. This is the plan Newton
  followed, in the papers which have at last been published.<a
  name="NtA_305" href="#Nt_305"><sup>[305]</sup></a></p>

  <p>So I, for one, thought little about the general tendency of orthodox
  writers to claim Bacon by means of the Paradoxes. I knew that, in his
  "Confession of Faith"<a name="NtA_306"
  href="#Nt_306"><sup>[306]</sup></a> he is a Trinitarian of a heterodox
  stamp. His second Person takes human nature before he took flesh, not for
  redemption, but as a condition precedent of creation. "God is so holy,
  pure, and jealous, that it is impossible for him to be pleased in any
  creature, though the work of his own hands.... [Gen. i. 10, 12, 18, 21,
  25, 31, freely rendered]. But&mdash;purposing to become a Creator, and to
  communicate to his creatures, he ordained in his eternal counsel that one
  person of the Godhead should be united to one nature, and to one
  particular of his creatures; that so, in the person of the Mediator, the
  true ladder might be fixed, whereby God might <!-- Page 145 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page145"></a>[145]</span>descend to his
  creatures and his creatures might ascend to God...."</p>

  <p>This is republished by the Religious Tract Society, and seems to suit
  their theology, for they confess to having omitted some things of which
  they disapprove.</p>

  <p>In 1864, Mr. Grosart published his discovery that the Paradoxes are by
  Herbert Palmer; that they were first published surreptitiously, and
  immediately afterwards by himself, both in 1645; that the "Remains" of
  Bacon did not appear until 1648; that from 1645 to 1708, thirteen
  editions of the "Memorials" were published, all containing the Paradoxes.
  In spite of this, the Paradoxes were introduced into Bacon's works in
  1730, where they have remained.</p>

  <p>Herbert Palmer was of good descent, and educated as a Puritan. He was
  an accomplished man, one of the few of his day who could speak French as
  well as English. He went into the Church, and was beneficed by Laud,<a
  name="NtA_307" href="#Nt_307"><sup>[307]</sup></a> in spite of his
  puritanism; he sat in the Assembly of Divines, and was finally President
  of Queens' College, Cambridge, in which post he died, August 13, 1647, in
  the 46th year of his age.</p>

  <p>Mr. Grosart says, speaking of Bacon's "Remains," "All who have had
  occasion to examine our early literature are aware that it was a common
  trick to issue imperfect, false, and unauthorized writings under any
  recently deceased name that might be expected to take. The Puritans, down
  to John Bunyan, were perpetually expostulating and protesting against
  such procedure." I have met with instances of all this; but I did not
  know that there was so much of it: a good collection would be very
  useful. The work of 1728, attributed to Newton, is likely enough to be
  one of the class.</p>

  <p>Propositions arranged after the manner of Euclid, with beings

  Royal Commission on the British Museum as an instance of the absurdity of
  attempting a <i>classed</i> catalogue from the <i>titles</i> of books.
  The title of this book sends it either to theology or geometry: when, in

  destroyed by the fortune of war in 1745, at Edinburgh: who will say the

  <p>This tract, which was not printed in the collected works, and is now
  excessively rare, is mentioned in <i>Notes and Queries</i>, 1st S., v,
  490, 573; 2d S., ix, 15. The boyish satire on Newton is amusing. Speaking
  of old Benjamin Martin,<a name="NtA_335"
  href="#Nt_335"><sup>[335]</sup></a> he goes on as follows:</p>

<p><!-- Page 153 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page153"></a>[153]</span></p>

  <p>"But the most elegant account of the matter [attraction] is by that
  hominiform animal, Mr. Benjamin Martin, who having attended Dr.
  Desaguliers'<a name="NtA_336" href="#Nt_336"><sup>[336]</sup></a> fine,
  raree, gallanty shew for some years [Desaguliers was one of the first who
  gave public experimental lectures, before the saucy boy was born] in the
  capacity of a turnspit, has, it seems, taken it into his head to set up
  for a philosopher."</p>

  <p>Thus is preserved the fact, unknown to his biographers, that Benj.
  Martin was an assistant to Desaguliers in his lectures. Hutton<a
  name="NtA_337" href="#Nt_337"><sup>[337]</sup></a> says of him, that "he
  was well skilled in the whole circle of the mathematical and
  philosophical sciences, and wrote useful books on every one of them":
  this is quite true; and even at this day he is read by twenty where Horne
  is read by one; see the stalls, <i>passim</i>. All that I say of him,
  indeed my knowledge of the tract, is due to this contemptuous mention of
  a more durable man than himself. My assistant secretary at the
  Astronomical Society, the late Mr. Epps,<a name="NtA_338"
  href="#Nt_338"><sup>[338]</sup></a> bought the copy at a stall because
  his eye was caught by the notice of "Old Ben Martin," of whom he was a
  great reader. Old Ben could not be a Fellow of the Royal Society, because
  he kept a shop: even though the shop sold nothing but philosophical
  instruments. Thomas Wright, similarly situated as to shop and goods,
  never was a Fellow. The Society of our day has greatly degenerated: those
  of the old time would be pleased, no doubt, that the glories of their day
  <!-- Page 154 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page154"></a>[154]</span>should be commemorated. In the early days
  of the Society, there was a similar difficulty about Graunt, the author
  of the celebrated work on mortality. But their royal patron, "who never
  said a foolish thing," sent them a sharp message, and charged them if
  they found any more such tradesmen, they should "elect them without more
  ado."</p>

  <p>Horne's first pamphlet was published when he was but twenty-one years
  old. Two years afterwards, being then a Fellow of his college, and having
  seen more of the world, he seems to have felt that his manner was a
  little too pert. He endeavored, it is said, to suppress his first tract:
  and copies are certainly of extreme rarity. He published the following as
  his maturer view:</p>

  such a system, has that demonstration; and consequently, what regard Mr.

  Oxford, 1753, 8vo.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>It must be remembered that the successors of Newton were very apt to
  declare that Newton had demonstrated attraction as a <i>physical</i>
  cause: he had taken reasonable pains to show that he did not pretend to
  this. If any one had said to Newton, I hold that every particle of matter
  is a responsible being of vast intellect, ordered by the Creator to move
  as it would do if every other particle attracted it, and gifted with
  power to make its way in true accordance with that law, as easily as a
  lady picks her way across the street; what have you to say against
  it?&mdash;Newton must have replied, Sir! if you really undertake to
  maintain this as <i>demonstrable</i>, your soul had better borrow a
  little power <!-- Page 155 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page155"></a>[155]</span>from the particles of which your body is
  made: if you merely ask me to refute it, I tell you that I neither can
  nor need do it; for whether attraction comes in this way or in any other,
  <i>it comes</i>, and that is all I have to do with it.</p>

  <p>The reader should remember that the word attraction, as used by Newton
  and the best of his followers, only meant a <i>drawing towards</i>,
  without any implication as to the cause. Thus whether they said that
  matter attracts matter, or that young lady attracts young gentleman, they
  were using one word in one sense. Newton found that the law of the first
  is the inverse square of the distance: I am not aware that the law of the
  second has been discovered; if there be any chance, we shall see it at
  the year 1856 in this list.</p>

  <p>In this point young Horne made a hit. He justly censures those who
  fixed upon Newton a more positive knowledge of what attraction is than he
  pretended to have. "He has owned over and over he did not know what he
  meant by it&mdash;it might be this, or it might be that, or it might be
  anything, or it might be nothing." With the exception of the
  <i>nothing</i> clause, this is true, though Newton might have answered
  Horne by "Thou hast said it."</p>

  <p>(I thought everybody knew the meaning of "Thou hast said it": but I
  was mistaken. In three of the evangelists <span title="Su legeis" class="grk"
  >&Sigma;&#x1F7A; &lambda;&#x1F73;&gamma;&epsilon;&iota;&sigmaf;</span> is
  the answer to "Art thou a king?" The force of this answer, as always
  understood, is "That is your way of putting it." The Puritans, who lived
  in Bible phrases, so understood it: and Walter Scott, who caught all
  peculiarities of language with great effect, makes a marked instance,
  "Were you armed?&mdash;I was not&mdash;I went in my calling, as a
  preacher of God's word, to encourage them that drew the sword in His
  cause. In other words, to aid and abet the rebels, said the Duke. <i>Thou
  hast spoken it</i>, replied the prisoner.")</p>

  <p>Again, Horne quotes Rowning<a name="NtA_340"
  href="#Nt_340"><sup>[340]</sup></a> as follows:</p>

<p><!-- Page 156 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page156"></a>[156]</span></p>

  <p>"Mr. Rowning, pt. 2, p. 5 in a note, has a very pretty conceit upon
  this same subject of attraction, about every particle of a fluid being
  intrenched in three spheres of attraction and repulsion, one within
  another, 'the innermost of which (he says) is a sphere of repulsion,
  which keeps them from approaching into contact; the next, a sphere of
  attraction, diffused around this of repulsion, by which the particles are
  disposed to run together into drops; and the outermost of all, a sphere
  of repulsion, whereby they repel each other, when removed out of the
  attraction.' So that between the <i>urgings</i>, and
  <i>solicitations</i>, of one and t'other, a poor unhappy particle must
  ever be at his wit's end, not knowing which way to turn, or whom to obey
  first."</p>

  <p>Rowning has here started the notion which Boscovich<a name="NtA_341"
  href="#Nt_341"><sup>[341]</sup></a> afterwards developed.</p>

  <p>I may add to what precedes that it cannot be settled that, as
  Granger<a name="NtA_342" href="#Nt_342"><sup>[342]</sup></a> says,
  Desaguliers was the first who gave experimental lectures in London.
  William Whiston gave some, and Francis Hauksbee<a name="NtA_343"
  href="#Nt_343"><sup>[343]</sup></a> made the experiments. The prospectus,
  as we should now call it, is extant, a quarto tract of plates and
  descriptions, without date. Whiston, in his life, <!-- Page 157 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page157"></a>[157]</span>gives 1714 as the first
  date of publication, and therefore, no doubt, of the lectures.
  Desaguliers removed to London soon after 1712, and commenced his lectures
  soon after that. It will be rather a nice point to settle which lectured
  first; probabilities seem to go in favor of Whiston.</p>

  lives. By W[eyman] L[ee]. London, 1737, 8vo.</p>

  <p>A valuation of Annuities and Leases certain, for a single life. By
  Weyman Lee, Esq. of the Inner Temple. London, 1751, 8vo. Third edition,
  1773.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Every branch of exact science has its paradoxer. The world at large
  cannot tell with certainty who is right in such questions as squaring the
  circle, etc. Mr. Weyman Lee<a name="NtA_344"
  href="#Nt_344"><sup>[344]</sup></a> was the assailant of what all who had
  studied called demonstration in the question of annuities. He can be
  exposed to the world: for his error arose out of his not being able to
  see that the whole is the sum of all its parts.</p>

  <p>By an annuity, say of £100, now bought, is meant that the buyer is to
  have for his money £100 in a year, if he be then alive, £100 at the end
  of two years, if then alive, and so on. It is clear that he would buy a
  life annuity if he should buy the first £100 in one office, the second in
  another, and so on. All the difference between buying the whole from one
  office and buying all the separate contingent payments at different
  offices, is immaterial to calculation. Mr. Lee would have agreed with the
  rest of the world about the payments to be made to the several different
  offices, in consideration of their several contracts: but he differed
  from every one else about the sum to be paid to <i>one</i> office. He
  contended that the way to value an annuity is to find out the term of
  years which the individual has an even chance of surviving, and to charge
  for the life annuity the value of an annuity certain for that term.</p>

<p><!-- Page 158 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page158"></a>[158]</span></p>

  <p>It is very common to say that Lee took the average life, or
  expectation, as it is wrongly called, for his term: and this I have done
  myself, taking the common story. Having exposed the absurdity of this
  second supposition, taking it for Lee's, in my <i>Formal Logic</i>,<a
  name="NtA_345" href="#Nt_345"><sup>[345]</sup></a> I will now do the same
  with the first.</p>

  <p>A mathematical truth is true in its extreme cases. Lee's principle is
  that an annuity on a life is the annuity made certain for the term within
  which it is an even chance the life drops. If, then, of a thousand
  persons, 500 be sure to die within a year, and the other 500 be immortal,
  Lee's price of an annuity to any one of these persons is the present
  value of one payment: for one year is the term which each one has an even
  chance of surviving and not surviving. But the true value is obviously
  half that of a perpetual annuity: so that at 5 percent Lee's rule would
  give less than the tenth of the true value. It must be said for the poor
  circle-squarers, that they never err so much as this.</p>

  <p>Lee would have said, if alive, that I have put an <i>extreme case</i>:
  but any <i>universal</i> truth is true in its extreme cases. It is not
  fair to bring forward an extreme case against a person who is speaking as
  of usual occurrences: but it is quite fair when, as frequently happens,
  the proposer insists upon a perfectly general acceptance of his
  assertion. And yet many who go the whole hog protest against being
  tickled with the tail. Counsel in court are good instances: they are
  paradoxers by trade. June 13, 1849, at Hertford, there was an action
  about a ship, insured against a <i>total</i> loss: some planks were
  saved, and the underwriters refused to pay. Mr.&nbsp;Z. (for deft.) "There can
  be no degrees of totality; and some timbers were saved."&mdash;L.&nbsp;C.&nbsp;B.
  "Then if the vessel were burned to the water's edge, and some rope saved
  in the boat, there would be no total loss."&mdash;Mr.&nbsp;Z. "This is putting
  a very extreme case."&mdash;L.&nbsp;C.&nbsp;B. "The argument <!-- Page 159 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page159"></a>[159]</span>would go that length."
  What would <i>Judge</i> Z.&mdash;as he now is&mdash;say to the extreme
  case beginning somewhere between six planks and a bit of rope?</p>

  href="#Nt_346"><sup>[346]</sup></a> It was a little episode to the great
  history of mathematics by Montucla, of which the first edition appeared
  in 1758. There was much addition at the end of the fourth volume of the

  volume is put together, with help from Montucla's papers, by Lalande.<a
  name="NtA_347" href="#Nt_347"><sup>[347]</sup></a> There is also a second
  edition of the history of the quadrature, Paris, 1831, 8vo, edited, I
  think, by Lacroix; of which it is the great fault that it makes hardly
  any use of the additional matter just mentioned.</p>

  <p>Montucla is an admirable historian when he is writing from his own
  direct knowledge: it is a sad pity that he did not tell us when he was
  depending on others. We are not to trust a quarter of his book, and we
  must read many other books to know which quarter. The fault is common
  enough, but Montucla's good three-quarters is so good that the fault is
  greater in him than in most others: I mean the fault of not
  acknowledging; for an historian cannot read everything. But it must be
  said that mankind give little encouragement to candor on this point.
  Hallam, in his <!-- Page 160 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page160"></a>[160]</span><i>History of Literature</i>, states with
  his own usual instinct of honesty every case in which he depends upon
  others: Montucla does not. And what is the consequence?&mdash;Montucla is
  trusted, and believed in, and cried up in the bulk; while the smallest
  talker can lament that Hallam should be so unequal and apt to depend on
  others, without remembering to mention that Hallam himself gives the
  information. As to a universal history of any great subject being written
  entirely upon primary knowledge, it is a thing of which the possibility
  is not yet proved by an example. Delambre attempted it with astronomy,
  and was removed by death before it was finished,<a name="NtA_348"
  href="#Nt_348"><sup>[348]</sup></a> to say nothing of the gaps he
  left.</p>

  <p>Montucla was nothing of a bibliographer, and his descriptions of books
  in the first edition were insufficient. The Abbé Rive<a name="NtA_349"
  href="#Nt_349"><sup>[349]</sup></a> fell foul of him, and as the phrase
  is, gave it him. Montucla took it with great good humor, tried to mend,
  and, in his second edition, wished his critic had lived to see the
  <i>vernis de bibliographe</i> which he had given himself.</p>

  <p>I have seen Montucla set down as an <i>esprit fort</i>, more than
  once: wrongly, I think. When he mentions Barrow's<a name="NtA_350"
  href="#Nt_350"><sup>[350]</sup></a> address to the Almighty, he adds, "On
  voit, au reste, par là, que Barrow étoit un pauvre philosophe; car il
  croyait en l'immortalité de l'âme, et en une Divinité autre que la nature
  <!-- Page 161 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page161"></a>[161]</span>universelle."<a name="NtA_351"
  href="#Nt_351"><sup>[351]</sup></a> This is irony, not an expression of
  opinion. In the book of mathematical recreations which Montucla
  constructed upon that of Ozanam,<a name="NtA_352"
  href="#Nt_352"><sup>[352]</sup></a> and Ozanam upon that of Van Etten,<a
  name="NtA_353" href="#Nt_353"><sup>[353]</sup></a> now best known in
  England by Hutton's similar treatment of Montucla, there is an amusing
  chapter on the quadrators. Montucla refers to his own anonymous book of
  1754 as a curious book published by Jombert.<a name="NtA_354"
  href="#Nt_354"><sup>[354]</sup></a> He seems to have been a little
  ashamed of writing about circle-squarers: what a slap on the face for an
  unborn Budgeteer!</p>

  <p>Montucla says, speaking of France, that he finds three notions
  prevalent among the cyclometers: (1) that there is a large reward offered
  for success; (2) that the longitude problem depends on that success; (3)
  that the solution is the great end and object of geometry. The same three
  <!-- Page 162 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page162"></a>[162]</span>notions are equally prevalent among the
  same class in England. No reward has ever been offered by the government
  of either country. The longitude problem in no way depends upon perfect
  solution; existing approximations are sufficient to a point of accuracy
  far beyond what can be wanted.<a name="NtA_355"
  href="#Nt_355"><sup>[355]</sup></a> And geometry, content with what
  exists, has long passed on to other matters. Sometimes a cyclometer
  persuades a skipper who has made land in the wrong place that the
  astronomers are in fault, for using a wrong measure of the circle; and
  the skipper thinks it a very comfortable solution! And this is the utmost
  that the problem ever has to do with longitude.</p>

<p class="cenhead">OFFICIAL BLOW TO CIRCLE SQUARERS.</p>

  <p>1755. The French Academy of Sciences came to the determination not to
  examine any more quadratures or kindred problems. This was the
  consequence, no doubt, of the publication of Montucla's book: the time
  was well chosen; for that book was a full justification of the
  resolution. The Royal Society followed the same course, I believe, a few
  years afterwards. When our Board of Longitude was in existence, most of
  its time was consumed in listening to schemes, many of which included the
  quadrature of the circle. It is certain that many quadrators have
  imagined the longitude problem to be connected with theirs: and no doubt
  the notion of a reward offered by Government for a true quadrature is a
  result of the reward offered for the longitude. Let it also be noted that
  this longitude reward was not a premium upon excogitation of a mysterious
  difficulty. The legislature was made to know that the rational hopes of
  the problem were centered in the improvement of the lunar tables and the
  improvement of chronometers. To these objects alone, and by name, the
  offer was directed: several persons gained rewards for both; and the

  <p>This was a gift from my oldest friend who was not a relative, Dr.

  <!-- Page 164 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  wonder is he never found more than one.</p>

  <p>The quadrature is not worth notice. Erichsen is the only squarer I
  have met with who has distinctly asserted the particulars of that reward
  which has been so frequently thought to have been offered in England. He
  says that in 1747 the Royal Society on the 2d of June, offered to give a
  large reward for the quadrature of the circle and a true explanation of
  magnetism, in addition to £30,000 previously promised for the same. I
  need hardly say that the Royal Society had not £30,000 at that time, and
  would not, if it had had such a sum, have spent it on the circle, nor on
  magnetic theory; nor would it have coupled the two things. On this book,
  see <i>Notes and Queries</i>, 1st S., xii, 306. Perhaps Erichsen meant
  that the £30,000 had been promised by the Government, and the addition by
  the Royal Society.</p>

  <p>October 8, 1866. I receive a letter from a cyclometer who understands
  that a reward is offered to any one who will square the circle, and that
  all competitors are to send their plans to me. The hoaxers have not yet
  failed out of the land.</p>

  <p>This is the famous work of Louis Claude de Saint-Martin<a
  name="NtA_370" href="#Nt_370"><sup>[370]</sup></a> (1743-1803), for whose
  other works, vagaries included, the reader must look elsewhere: among
  other things, he was a translator of Jacob Behmen.<a name="NtA_371"
  href="#Nt_371"><sup>[371]</sup></a> The title promises much, and the
  writer has smart thoughts now and then; but the whole is the wearisome
  omniscience of the author's day and country, which no reader of our time
  can tolerate. Not that we dislike omniscience; but we have it of our own
  country, both home-made and imported; and fashions vary. But surely there
  can be but one omniscience? Must a man have but one wife? Nay, may not a
  man have a new wife while the old one is living? There was a famous
  instrumental professor forty years ago, who presented a friend to Madame
  &mdash;&mdash;. The friend started, and looked surprised; for, not many
  weeks before, he had been presented to another lady, with the same title,
  at Paris. The musician observed his surprise, and quietly said, "Celle-ci
  est Madame &mdash;&mdash; de Londres." In like manner we have a London
  omniscience now current, which would make any one start who only knew the
  old French article.</p>

  <p>The book was printed at Lyons, but it was a trick of French authors to
  pretend to be afraid of prosecution: it <!-- Page 169 --><span

  wicked-like to have a feigned place of printing, and stimulated readers.

  A likely book to want an <i>Edimbourg</i> godfather!</p>

  <p>Saint-Martin is great in mathematics. The number <i>four</i>
  essentially belongs to straight lines, and <i>nine</i> to curves. The
  object of a straight line is to perpetuate <i>ad infinitum</i> the
  production of a point from which it emanates. A circle <a
  href="images/adem_177.png"><img src="images/adem_177.png" class="middle"
  style="height:2ex" alt="circle" /></a> bounds the production of all its
  radii, tends to destroy them, and is in some sort their enemy. How is it
  possible that things so distinct should not be distinguished in their
  <i>number</i> as well as in their action? If this important observation
  had been made earlier, immense trouble would have been saved to the
  mathematicians, who would have been prevented from searching for a common
  measure to lines which have nothing in common. But, though all straight
  lines have the number <i>four</i>, it must not be supposed that they are
  all equal, for a line is the result of its law and <!-- Page 170 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page170"></a>[170]</span>its number; but though
  both are the same for all lines of a sort, they act differently, as to
  force, energy, and duration, in different individuals; which explains all
  differences of length, etc. I congratulate the reader who understands
  this; and I do not pity the one who does not.</p>

  <p>Saint-Martin and his works are now as completely forgotten as if they
  had never been born, except so far as this, that some one may take up one
  of the works as of heretical character, and lay it down in
  disappointment, with the reflection that it is as dull as orthodoxy. For
  a person who was once in some vogue, it would be difficult to pick out a
  more fossil writer, from Aa to Zyp&oelig;us, except,&mdash;though it is
  unusual for (,&mdash;) to represent an interval of more than a

  <p>When did we three meet before? The first work has sunk into oblivion:
  had it merited its title, it might have <!-- Page 174 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page174"></a>[174]</span>lived. It is what the
  French call a <i>pièce de circonstance</i>; it belongs in time to the
  French Revolution, and in matter to Burke's opinion of that movement.
  Those who only know its name think it was really an attempt to write a
  philosophical treatise on what we now call socialism. Silly government
  prosecutions gave it what it never could have got for itself.</p>

  <p>Mary Wollstonecraft seldom has her name spelled right. I suppose the
  O! O! character she got made her W<i>oo</i>lstonecraft. Watt gives double
  insinuation, for his cross-reference sends us to G<i>oo</i>dwin.<a
  name="NtA_391" href="#Nt_391"><sup>[391]</sup></a> No doubt the title of
  the book was an act of discipleship to Paine's <i>Rights of Man</i>; but
  this title is very badly chosen. The book was marred by it, especially
  when the authoress and her husband assumed the right of dispensing with
  legal sanction until the approach of offspring brought them to a sense of
  their child's interest.<a name="NtA_392"
  href="#Nt_392"><sup>[392]</sup></a> Not a hint of such a claim is found
  in the book, which is mostly about female education. The right claimed
  for woman is to have the education of a rational human being, and not to
  be considered as nothing but woman throughout youthful training. The
  maxims of Mary Wollstonecraft are now, though not derived from her,
  largely followed in the education of girls, especially in home education:
  just as many of the political principles of Tom Paine, again not derived
  from him, are the guides of our actual legislation. I remember, forty
  years ago, an old lady used to declare that she disliked girls from the
  age of sixteen to five-and-twenty. "They are full," said she, "of
  <i>femalities</i>." She spoke of their behavior to women as well as to
  men. She <!-- Page 175 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page175"></a>[175]</span>would have been shocked to know that she
  was a follower of Mary Wollstonecraft, and had packed half her book into
  one sentence.</p>

  <p>The third work is a satirical attack on Mary Wollstonecraft and Tom
  Paine. The details of the attack would convince any one that neither has
  anything which would now excite reprobation. It is utterly unworthy of
  Dr. Parr, and has quite disappeared from lists of his works, if it were
  ever there. That it was written by him I take to be evident, as follows.
  Nichols,<a name="NtA_393" href="#Nt_393"><sup>[393]</sup></a> who could
  not fail to know, says (<i>Anecd.</i>, vol. ix, p. 120): "This is a
  playful essay by a first-rate scholar, who is elsewhere noticed in this
  volume, but whose name I shall not bring forward on so trifling an
  occasion." Who the scholar was is made obvious by Master Launcelot being
  made to talk of Bellendenus.<a name="NtA_394"
  href="#Nt_394"><sup>[394]</sup></a> Further, the same boy is made to say,
  "Let Dr. Parr lay his hand upon his heart, if his conscience will let
  him, and ask himself how many thousands of wagon-loads of this article
  [birch] he has cruelly misapplied." How could this apply to Parr, with
  his handful of private pupils,<a name="NtA_395"
  href="#Nt_395"><sup>[395]</sup></a> and no reputation for severity? Any
  one except himself would have called on the head-master of Westminster or
  Eton. I doubt whether the name of Parr could be connected with the rod by
  anything in print, except the above and an anecdote of his pupil, Tom
  Sheridan.<a name="NtA_396" href="#Nt_396"><sup>[396]</sup></a> The Doctor
  had dressed for a dinner visit, and <!-- Page 176 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page176"></a>[176]</span>was ready a quarter of
  an hour too soon to set off. "Tom," said he, "I think I had better whip
  you now; you are sure to do something while I am out."&mdash;"I wish you
  would, sir!" said the boy; "it would be a letter of licence for the whole
  evening." The Doctor saw the force of the retort: my two tutelaries will
  see it by this time. They paid in advance; and I have given liberal
  interpretation to the order.</p>

  <p>The following story of Dr. Parr was told me and others, about 1829, by
  the late Leonard Horner,<a name="NtA_397"
  href="#Nt_397"><sup>[397]</sup></a> who knew him intimately. Parr was
  staying in a house full of company, I think in the north of England. Some
  gentlemen from America were among the guests, and after dinner they
  disputed some of Parr's assertions or arguments. So the Doctor broke out
  with "Do you know what country you come from? You come from the place to
  which we used to send our thieves!" This made the host angry, and he gave
  Parr such a severe rebuke as sent him from the room in ill-humor. The
  rest walked on the lawn, amusing the Americans with sketches of the
  Doctor. There was a dark cloud overhead, and from that cloud presently
  came a voice which called <i>Tham</i> (Parr-lisp for <i>Sam</i>). The
  company were astonished for a moment, but thought the Doctor was calling
  his servant in the house, and that the apparent direction was an illusion
  arising out of inattention. But presently the sound was repeated,
  certainly from the cloud,</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"And nearer, clearer, deadlier than before."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>There was now a little alarm: where could the Doctor have got to? They
  ran to his bedroom, and there they discovered a sufficient rather than
  satisfactory explanation. The Doctor had taken his pipe into his bedroom,
  and had seated himself, in sulky mood, upon the higher bar of a large and
  deep old-fashioned grate with a high mantelshelf. Here he had <!-- Page
  177 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page177"></a>[177]</span>tumbled
  backwards, and doubled himself up between the bars and the back of the
  grate. He was fixed tight, and when he called for help, he could only
  throw his voice up the chimney. The echo from the cloud was the warning
  which brought his friends to the rescue.</p>

  <p>Days of political paradox were coming, at which we now stare.
  Cobbett<a name="NtA_398" href="#Nt_398"><sup>[398]</sup></a> said, about
  1830, in earnest, that in the country every man who did not take off his
  hat to the clergyman was suspected, and ran a fair chance of having
  something brought against him. I heard this assertion canvassed, when it
  was made, in a party of elderly persons. The Radicals backed it, the old
  Tories rather denied it, but in a way which satisfied me they ought to
  have denied it less if they could not deny it more. But it must be said
  that the Governments stopped far short of what their partisans would have
  had them do. All who know Robert Robinson's<a name="NtA_399"

  festivals in his <i>History and Mystery of Good Friday</i> (1777)<a

  unprovoked, and malicious libel on the most <!-- Page 178 --><span

  the national Church. It was reprinted again and again: in 1811 it was in
  a cheap form at 6s. 6d. a hundred. When the Jacobin day came, the State
  was really in a fright: people thought twice before they published what
  would now be quite disregarded. I examined a quantity of letters
  addressed to George Dyer<a name="NtA_401"
  href="#Nt_401"><sup>[401]</sup></a> (Charles Lamb's G.D.) and what

  a packet which produced five guineas, or thereabouts, for the widow.
  Among them were the following verses, sent by the author&mdash;who would
  not put his name, even in a private letter, for fear of
  accidents&mdash;for consultation whether they could safely be sent to an
  editor: and they were <i>not</i> sent. The occasion was the public
  thanksgiving at St. Paul's for the naval victories, December 19,
  1797.</p>

  <p>Perhaps had this been published, the Government would have assailed it
  as a libel on the church service. They got into the way of defending
  themselves by making libels on the Church, of what were libels, if on
  anything, on the rulers of the State; until the celebrated trials of Hone
  settled the point for ever, and established that juries will not convict
  for one offence, even though it have been committed, when they know the
  prosecution is directed at another offence and another intent.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="cenhead">HONE'S FAMOUS TRIALS.</p>

  <p>The results of Hone's trials (William Hone, 1779-1842) are among the
  important constitutional victories of our century. He published parodies
  on the Creeds, the Lord's Prayer, the Catechism, etc., with intent to
  bring the Ministry into contempt: everybody knew that was his
  <i>purpose</i>. The Government indicted him for impious, profane,
  blasphemous intent, but not for seditious intent. They hoped to wear him
  out by proceeding day by day. December 18, 1817, they hid themselves
  under the Lord's Prayer, the Creed, and the Commandments; December 19,
  under the Litany; December 20, under the Athanasian Creed, an odd place
  for shelter when they could not find it in the previous places. Hone
  defended himself for six, seven, and eight hours on the several days: and
  the jury acquitted him in 15, 105, and 20 minutes. In the second trial
  the offense was laid both as profanity and as sedition, which seems to
  have made the jury hesitate. And they probably came to think that the
  second count was false pretence: but the length of their deliberation is
  a satisfactory addition to the value of the whole. In the first trial the
  Attorney-General (Shepherd) had the impudence to say that the libel had
  nothing of a political tendency about it, but was <i>avowedly</i> set off
  against the religion and worship of the Church of England. The whole <!--
  Page 181 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page181"></a>[181]</span>is
  political in every sentence; neither more nor less political than the
  following, which is part of the parody on the Catechism: "What is thy
  duty towards the Minister? My duty towards the Minister is, to trust him
  as much as I can; to honor him with all my words, with all my bows, with
  all my scrapes, and with all my cringes; to flatter him; to give him
  thanks; to give up my whole soul to him; to idolize his name, and obey
  his word, and serve him blindly all the days of his political life." And
  the parody on the Creed begins, "I believe in George, the Regent
  almighty, maker of new streets and Knights of the Bath." This is what the
  Attorney-General said had nothing of a political tendency about it. But
  this was <i>on the first trial</i>: Hone was not known. The first day's
  trial was under Justice Abbott (afterwards C.&nbsp;J. Tenterden).<a
  name="NtA_405" href="#Nt_405"><sup>[405]</sup></a> It was perfectly
  understood, when Chief Justice Ellenborough<a name="NtA_406"
  href="#Nt_406"><sup>[406]</sup></a> appeared in Court on the second day,
  that he was very angry at the first result, and put his junior aside to
  try his own rougher dealing. But Hone tamed the lion. An eye-witness told
  me that when he implored of Hone not to detail his own father Bishop
  Law's<a name="NtA_407" href="#Nt_407"><sup>[407]</sup></a> views on the
  Athanasian Creed, which humble petition Hone kindly granted, he held by
  the desk for support. And the same when&mdash;which is not
  reported&mdash;the Attorney-General appealed to the Court for protection
  against a <!-- Page 182 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page182"></a>[182]</span>stinging attack which Hone made on the
  Bar: he <i>held on</i>, and said, "Mr. Attorney, what <i>can</i> I do!" I
  was a boy of twelve years old, but so strong was the feeling of
  exultation at the verdicts that boys at school were not prohibited from
  seeing the parodies, which would have been held at any other time quite
  unfit to meet their eyes. I was not able to comprehend all about the Lord
  Chief Justice until I read and heard again in after years. In the
  meantime, Joe Miller had given me the story of the leopard which was sent
  home on board a ship of war, and was in two days made as docile as a cat
  by the sailors.<a name="NtA_408" href="#Nt_408"><sup>[408]</sup></a> "You
  have got that fellow well under," said an officer. "Lord bless your
  Honor!" said Jack, "if the Emperor of Marocky would send us a cock
  rhinoceros, we'd bring him to his bearings in no time!" When I came to
  the subject again, it pleased me to entertain the question whether, if
  the Emperor had sent a cock rhinoceros to preside on the third day in the
  King's Bench, Hone would have mastered <i>him</i>: I forget how I settled
  it. There grew up a story that Hone caused Lord Ellenborough's death, but
  this could not have been true. Lord Ellenborough resigned his seat in a
  few months, and died just a year after the trials; but sixty-eight years
  may have had more to do with it than his defeat.</p>

  <p>A large subscription was raised for Hone, headed by the Duke of
  Bedford<a name="NtA_409" href="#Nt_409"><sup>[409]</sup></a> for £105.
  Many of the leading anti-ministerialists joined: but there were many of
  the other side who avowed their disapprobation of the false pretense.
  Many could not venture their names. In the list I find: <!-- Page 183
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page183"></a>[183]</span>A member of
  the House of Lords, an enemy to persecution, and especially to religious
  persecution employed for political purposes&mdash;No parodist, but an

  and won three heats by twelve to one, £1 16s.&mdash;A conscientious

  disapproves of the parodies, but abhors the making an affected zeal for
  religion the pretext for political persecution&mdash;A Lawyer opposed in
  principle to <!-- Page 184 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page184"></a>[184]</span>Law&mdash;For the Hone that set the razor
  that shaved the rats&mdash;Rev. Dr. Samuel Parr, who most seriously
  disapproves of all parodies upon the hallowed language of Scripture and
  the contents of the Prayer-book, but acquits Mr. Hone of intentional
  impiety, admires his talents and fortitude, and applauds the good sense
  and integrity of his juries&mdash;Religion without hypocrisy, and Law
  without impartiality&mdash;O Law! O Law! O Law!</p>

  <p>These are specimens of a great many allusive mottoes. The subscription
  was very large, and would have bought a handsome annuity, but Hone
  employed it in the bookselling trade, and did not thrive. His <i>Everyday
  Book</i><a name="NtA_411" href="#Nt_411"><sup>[411]</sup></a> and his
  <i>Apocryphal New Testament</i>,<a name="NtA_412"
  href="#Nt_412"><sup>[412]</sup></a> are useful books. On an annuity he
  would have thriven as an antiquarian writer and collector. It is well
  that the attack upon the right to ridicule Ministers roused a dormant
  power which was equal to the occasion. Hone declared, on his honor, that
  he had never addressed a meeting in his life, nor spoken a word before
  more than twelve persons. Had he&mdash;which however could not then be
  done&mdash;employed counsel and had a <i>guilty defense</i> made for him,
  he would very likely have been convicted, and the work would have been
  left to be done by another. No question that the parodies disgusted all
  who reverenced Christianity, and who could not separate the serious and
  the ludicrous, and prevent their existence in combination.</p>

  <p>My extracts, etc., are from the nineteenth, seventeenth, and sixteenth
  editions of the three trials, which seem to have been contemporaneous
  (all in 1818) as they are made up into one book, with additional title
  over all, and the motto "Thrice the brindled cat hath mew'd." They are
  published by Hone himself, who I should have said was a publisher <!--
  Page 185 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page185"></a>[185]</span>as
  well as was to be. And though the trials only ended Dec. 20, 1817, the
  preface attached to this common title is dated Jan. 23, 1818.<a
  name="NtA_413" href="#Nt_413"><sup>[413]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The spirit which was roused against the false dealing of the
  Government, i.e., the pretense of prosecuting for impiety when all the
  world knew the real offense was, if anything, sedition&mdash;was not got
  up at the moment: there had been previous exhibitions of it. For example,
  in the spring of 1818 Mr. Russell, a little printer in Birmingham, was
  indicted for publishing the Political Litany<a name="NtA_414"
  href="#Nt_414"><sup>[414]</sup></a> on which Hone was afterwards tried.
  He took his witnesses to the summer Warwick assizes, and was told that
  the indictment had been removed by certiorari into the King's Bench. He
  had notice of trial for the spring assizes at Warwick: he took his
  witnesses there, and the trial was postponed by the Crown. He then had
  notice for the summer assizes at Warwick; and so on. The policy seems to
  have been to wear out the obnoxious parties, either by delays or by
  heaping on trials. The Government was odious, and knew it could
  <i>not</i> get verdicts against ridicule, and <i>could</i> get verdicts
  against impiety. No difficulty was found in convicting the sellers of
  Paine's works, and the like. When Hone was held to bail it was seen that
  a crisis was at hand. All parties in politics furnished him with parodies
  in proof of religious persons having made instruments of them. The
  parodies by Addison and Luther were contributed by a Tory lawyer, who was
  afterwards a judge.</p>

  <p>Hone had published, in 1817, tracts of purely political ridicule:
  <i>Official Account of the Noble Lord's Bite,</i><a name="NtA_415"
  href="#Nt_415"><sup>[415]</sup></a> <i>Trial of the Dog for Biting the
  Noble Lord</i>, etc. These were not touched. After the trials, it is
  manifest that Hone was <!-- Page 186 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page186"></a>[186]</span>to be unassailed, do what he might. <i>The
  Political House that Jack built</i>, in 1819; <i>The Man in the Moon</i>,
  1820; <i>The Queen's Matrimonial Ladder</i>, <i>Non mi ricordo</i>,
  <i>The R&mdash;l Fowls</i>, 1820; <i>The Political Showman at Home</i>,
  with plates by G. Cruickshank,<a name="NtA_416"
  href="#Nt_416"><sup>[416]</sup></a> 1821 [he did all the plates]; <i>The
  Spirit of Despotism</i>, 1821&mdash;would have been legitimate marks for
  prosecution in previous years. The biting caricature of several of these
  works are remembered to this day. <i>The Spirit of Despotism</i> was a
  tract of 1795, of which a few copies had been privately circulated with
  great secrecy. Hone reprinted it, and prefixed the following address to
  "Robert Stewart, <i>alias</i> Lord Castlereagh"<a name="NtA_417"
  href="#Nt_417"><sup>[417]</sup></a>: "It appears to me that if,
  unhappily, your counsels are allowed much longer to prevail in the
  Brunswick Cabinet, they will bring on a crisis, in which the king may be
  dethroned or the people enslaved. Experience has shown that the people
  will not be enslaved&mdash;the alternative is the affair of your
  employers." Hone might say this without notice.</p>

  <p>In 1819 Mr. Murray<a name="NtA_418"
  href="#Nt_418"><sup>[418]</sup></a> published Lord Byron's <i>Don
  Juan</i>,<a name="NtA_419" href="#Nt_419"><sup>[419]</sup></a> and Hone
  followed it with <i>Don John, or Don Juan Unmasked</i>, a little account
  of what the publisher to the Admiralty was allowed to issue without
  prosecution. The parody on the Commandments was a case very much in
  point: and Hone makes a stinging allusion to the use of the
  "<i>unutterable Name</i>, with a profane levity unsurpassed by <!-- Page
  187 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page187"></a>[187]</span>any other
  two lines in the English language." The lines are</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"'Tis strange&mdash;the Hebrew noun which means 'I am,'</p>
      <p>The English always use to govern d&mdash;&mdash;n."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Hone ends with: "Lord Byron's dedication of 'Don Juan' to Lord
  Castlereagh was suppressed by Mr. Murray from delicacy to Ministers. Q.
  Why did not Mr. Murray suppress Lord Byron's <i>parody</i> on the Ten
  Commandments? <i>A.</i> Because it contains nothing in ridicule of
  Ministers, and therefore nothing that <i>they</i> could suppose would
  lead to the displeasure of Almighty God."</p>

  <p>The little matters on which I have dwelt will never appear in history
  from their political importance, except in a few words of result. As a
  mode of thought, silly evasions of all kinds belong to such a work as the
  present. Ignorance, which seats itself in the chair of knowledge, is a
  mother of revolutions in politics, and of unread pamphlets in
  circle-squaring. From 1815 to 1830 the question of revolution or no
  revolution lurked in all our English discussions. The high classes must
  govern; the high classes shall not govern; and thereupon issue was to be
  joined. In 1828-33 the question came to issue; and it was, Revolution
  with or without civil war; choose. The choice was wisely made; and the
  Reform Bill started a new system so well dovetailed into the old that the
  joinings are hardly visible. And now, in 1867, the thing is repeated with
  a marked subsidence of symptoms; and the party which has taken the place
  of the extinct Tories is carrying through Parliament a wider extension of
  the franchise than their opponents would have ventured. Napoleon used to
  say that a decided nose was a sign of power: on which it has been
  remarked that he had good reason to say so before the play was done. And
  so had our country; it was saved from a religious war, and from a civil
  war, by the power of that nose over its colleagues. <!-- Page 188

  <p>The reputation of "the Platonist" begins to grow, and will continue to
  grow. The most authentic account is in the <i>Penny Cyclopædia</i>,
  written by one of the few persons who knew him well, and one of the fewer
  who possess all his works. At page lvi of the Introduction is Taylor's
  notion of the way to find the circumference. It is not geometrical, for
  it proceeds on the motion of a point: the words "on account of the
  simplicity of the impulsive motion, such a line must be either straight
  or circular" will suffice to show how Platonic it is. Taylor certainly
  professed a kind of heathenism. D'lsraeli said, "Mr. T. Taylor, the
  Platonic philosopher and the modern Plethon,<a name="NtA_423"
  href="#Nt_423"><sup>[423]</sup></a> consonant to that philosophy,
  professes polytheism." Taylor printed this in large type, in a page by
  itself after the dedication, without any disavowal. I have seen the
  following, Greek and translation both, in his handwriting: "<span
  title="Pas agathos hêi agathos ethnikos; kai pas christianos hêi christianos kakos." class="grk"
  >&Pi;&#x1FB6;&sigmaf; &#x1F00;&gamma;&alpha;&theta;&#x1F78;&sigmaf;

  &kappa;&alpha;&kappa;&#x1F79;&sigmaf;.</span> Every good man, so far as
  he is a good man, is a heathen; and every Christian, so far as he is a
  Christian, is a bad man." Whether Taylor had in his head the Christian of
  the New Testament, or whether he drew from those members of the
  "religious world" who make manifest the religious flesh and the religious
  devil, <!-- Page 189 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page189"></a>[189]</span>cannot be decided by us, and perhaps was
  not known to himself. If a heathen, he was a virtuous one.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="cenhead">A NEW ERA IN FICTION.</p>

  <p>(1795.) This is the date of a very remarkable paradox. The religious
  world&mdash;to use a name claimed by a doctrinal sect&mdash;had long set
  its face against amusing literature, and all works of imagination.
  Bunyan, Milton, and a few others were irresistible; but a long face was
  pulled at every attempt to produce something readable for poor people and
  <i>poor children</i>. In 1795, a benevolent association began to
  circulate the works of a lady who had been herself a dramatist, and had
  nourished a pleasant vein of satire in the society of Garrick and his
  friends; all which is carefully suppressed in some biographies. Hannah
  More's<a name="NtA_424" href="#Nt_424"><sup>[424]</sup></a> <i>Cheap
  Repository Tracts</i>,<a name="NtA_425"
  href="#Nt_425"><sup>[425]</sup></a> which were bought by millions of
  copies, destroyed the vicious publications with which the hawkers deluged
  the country, by the simple process of furnishing the hawkers with
  something more saleable.</p>

  <p><i>Dramatic fiction</i>, in which the <i>characters</i> are drawn by
  themselves, was, at the middle of the last century, the monopoly of
  writers who required indecorum, such as Fielding and Smollett. All, or
  nearly all, which could be permitted to the young, was dry narrative,
  written by people who could not make their personages <i>talk
  character</i>; they all spoke <!-- Page 190 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page190"></a>[190]</span>alike. The author of the <i>Rambler</i><a
  name="NtA_426" href="#Nt_426"><sup>[426]</sup></a> is ridiculed, because
  his young ladies talk Johnsonese; but the satirists forget that all the
  presentable novel-writers were equally incompetent; even the author of
  <i>Zeluco</i> (1789)<a name="NtA_427" href="#Nt_427"><sup>[427]</sup></a>
  is the strongest possible case in point.</p>

  <p>Dr. Moore,<a name="NtA_428" href="#Nt_428"><sup>[428]</sup></a> the
  father of the hero of Corunna,<a name="NtA_429"
  href="#Nt_429"><sup>[429]</sup></a> with good narrative power, some sly
  humor, and much observation of character, would have been, in our day, a
  writer of the <i>Peacock</i><a name="NtA_430"
  href="#Nt_430"><sup>[430]</sup></a> family. Nevertheless, to one who is
  accustomed to our style of things, it is comic to read the dialogue of a
  jealous husband, a suspected wife, a faithless maid-servant, a tool of a
  nurse, a wrong-headed pomposity of a priest, and a sensible physician,
  all talking Dr. Moore through their masks. Certainly an Irish soldier
  does say "by Jasus," and a cockney footman "this here" and "that there";
  and this and the like is all the painting of characters which is effected
  out of the mouths of the bearers by a narrator of great power. I suspect
  that some novelists repressed their power under a rule that a narrative
  should narrate, and that the dramatic should be confined to the
  drama.</p>

  <p>I make no exception in favor of Miss Burney;<a name="NtA_431"
  href="#Nt_431"><sup>[431]</sup></a> though she was the forerunner of a
  new era. Suppose a country <!-- Page 191 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page191"></a>[191]</span>in which dress is always of one color;
  suppose an importer who brings in cargoes of blue stuff, red stuff, green
  stuff, etc., and exhibits dresses of these several colors, that person is
  the similitude of Miss Burney. It would be a delightful change from a
  universal dull brown, to see one person all red, another all blue, etc.;
  but the real inventor of pleasant dress would be the one who could mix
  his colors and keep down the bright and gaudy. Miss Burney's introduction
  was so charming, by contrast, that she nailed such men as Johnson, Burke,
  Garrick, etc., to her books. But when a person who has read them with
  keen pleasure in boyhood, as I did, comes back to them after a long
  period, during which he has made acquaintance with the great novelists of
  our century, three-quarters of the pleasure is replaced by wonder that he
  had not seen he was at a puppet-show, not at a drama. Take some
  <i>labeled</i> characters out of our humorists, let them be put together
  into one piece, to speak only as labeled: let there be a Dominie with
  nothing but "Prodigious!" a Dick Swiveller with nothing but adapted
  quotations; a Dr. Folliott with nothing but sneers at Lord Brougham;<a

  Page 192 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page192"></a>[192]</span>are,
  I believe, all the Minerva Press novels, as they were called, which show
  some of the power in question. Perhaps dramatic talent found its best
  encouragement in the drama itself. But I cannot ascertain that any such
  power was directed at the multitude, whether educated or uneducated, with
  natural mixture of character, under the restraints of decorum, until the
  use of it by two religious writers of the school called "evangelical,"
  Hannah More and Rowland Hill.<a name="NtA_437"
  href="#Nt_437"><sup>[437]</sup></a> The <i>Village Dialogues</i>, though
  not equal to the <i>Repository Tracts</i>, are in many parts an approach,
  and perhaps a copy; there is frequently humorous satire, in that most
  effective form, self-display. They were published in 1800, and, partly at
  least, by the Religious Tract Society, the lineal <span
  class="correction" title="text reads `successsor'">successor</span> of
  the <i>Repository</i> association, though knowing nothing about its
  predecessor. I think it right to add that Rowland Hill here mentioned is
  not the regenerator of the Post Office.<a name="NtA_438"
  href="#Nt_438"><sup>[438]</sup></a> Some do not distinguish accurately; I
  have heard of more than one who took me to have had a logical controversy
  with a diplomatist who died some years before I was born.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="cenhead">THE RELIGIOUS TRACT SOCIETY.</p>

  <p>A few years ago, an attempt was made by myself and others to collect
  some information about the <i>Cheap Repository</i> (see <i>Notes and
  Queries</i>, 3d Series, vi. 241, 290, 353; <i>Christian Observer</i>,
  Dec. 1864, pp. 944-49). It appeared that after the Religious Tract
  Society had existed more than fifty years, a friend presented it with a
  copy of the original prospectus of the <i>Repository</i>, a thing the
  existence of which was not known. In this prospectus it is announced that
  from the plan "will be carefully excluded whatever is enthusiastic,
  absurd, or superstitious." The "evangelical" <!-- Page 193 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page193"></a>[193]</span>party had, from the
  foundation of the Religious Tract Society, regretted that the
  <i>Repository Tracts</i> "did not contain a fuller statement of the great
  evangelical principles"; while in the prospectus it is also stated that
  "no cause of any particular party is intended to be served by it, but
  general Christianity will be promoted upon practical principles." This
  explains what has often been noticed, that the tracts contain a mild form
  of "evangelical" doctrine, free from that more fervid dogmatism which
  appears in the <i>Village Dialogues</i>; and such as H. More's friend,
  Bishop Porteus<a name="NtA_439"
  href="#Nt_439"><sup>[439]</sup></a>&mdash;a great promoter of the
  scheme&mdash;might approve. The Religious Tract Society (in 1863)
  republished some of H. More's tracts, with alterations, additions, and
  omissions <i>ad libitum</i>. This is an improper way of dealing with the
  works of the dead; especially when the reprints are of popular works. A
  small type addition to the preface contains: "Some alterations and
  abridgements have been made to adapt them to the present times and the
  aim of the Religious Tract Society." I think every publicity ought to be
  given to the existence of such a practice; and I reprint what I said on
  the subject in <i>Notes and Queries</i>.</p>

  <p>Alterations in works which the Society republishes are a necessary
  part of their plan, though such notes as they should judge to be
  corrective would be the best way of proceeding. But the fact of
  alteration should be very distinctly announced on the title of the work
  itself, not left to a little bit of small type at the end of the preface,
  in the place where trade advertisements, or directions to the binder, are
  often found. And the places in which alteration has been made should be
  pointed out, either by marks of omission, when omission is the
  alteration, or by putting the altered sentences in brackets, when change
  has been made. May any one alter the works of the dead at his own
  discretion? <!-- Page 194 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page194"></a>[194]</span>We all know that readers in general will
  take each sentence to be that of the author whose name is on the title;
  so that a correcting republisher <i>makes use of his author's name to
  teach his own variation</i>. The tortuous logic of "the trade," which is
  content when "the world" is satisfied, is not easily answered, any more
  than an eel is easily caught; but the Religious Tract Society may be
  <i>convinced</i> [in the old sense] in a sentence. On which course would
  they feel most safe in giving their account to the God of truth? "In your
  own conscience, now?"</p>

  <p>I have tracked out a good many of the variations made by the Religious
  Tract Society in the recently published volume of <i>Repository
  Tracts</i>. Most of them are doctrinal insertions or amplifications, to
  the matter of which Hannah More would not have objected&mdash;all that
  can be brought against them is the want of notice. But I have found two
  which the respect I have for the Religious Tract Society, in spite of
  much difference on various points, must not prevent my designating as
  paltry. In the story of Mary Wood, a kind-hearted clergyman converses
  with the poor girl who has ruined herself by lying. In the original, he
  "assisted her in the great work of repentance;" in the reprint it is to
  be shown in some detail how he did this. He is to begin by pointing out
  that "the heart is deceitful above all things and desperately wicked."
  Now the clergyman's name is <i>Heartwell</i>: so to prevent his name from
  contradicting his doctrine, he is actually cut down to <i>Harwell</i>.
  Hannah Moore meant this good man for one of those described in Acts xv.
  8, 9, and his name was appropriate.</p>

  <p>Again, Mr. Flatterwell, in persuasion of Parley the porter to let him
  into the castle, declares that the worst he will do is to "play an
  innocent game of cards just to keep you awake, or sing a cheerful song
  with the maids." Oh fie! Miss Hannah More! and you a single lady too, and
  a contemporary of the virtuous Bowdler!<a name="NtA_440"
  href="#Nt_440"><sup>[440]</sup></a> Though Flatterwell be an <!-- Page
  195 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page195"></a>[195]</span>allegory
  of the devil, this is really too indecorous, even for him. Out with the
  three last words! and out it is.</p>

  <p>The Society cuts a poor figure before a literary tribunal. Nothing was
  wanted except an admission that the remarks made by me were unanswerable,
  and this was immediately furnished by the Secretary (<i>N. and Q.</i>, 3d
  S., vi. 290). In a reply of which six parts out of seven are a very
  amplified statement that the Society did not intend to reprint <i>all</i>
  Hannah More's tracts, the remaining seventh is as follows:</p>

  <p>"I am not careful [perhaps this should be <i>careful not</i>] to
  notice Professor De Morgan's objections to the changes in 'Mary Wood' or
  'Parley the Porter,' but would merely reiterate that the tracts were
  neither designed nor announced to be 'reprints' of the originals [design
  is only known to the designers; as to announcement, the title is ''Tis
  all for the best, The Shepherd of Salisbury Plain, and other narratives
  by Hannah More']; and much less [this must be <i>careful not</i>; further
  removed from answer than <i>not careful</i>] can I occupy your space by a
  treatise on the Professor's question: 'May any one alter the works of the
  dead at his own discretion?'"</p>

  <p>To which I say: Thanks for help!</p>

  <p>I predict that Hannah More's <i>Cheap Repository Tracts</i> will
  somewhat resemble the <i>Pilgrim's Progress</i> in their fate. Written
  for the cottage, and long remaining in their original position, they will
  become classical works of their kind. Most assuredly this will happen if
  my assertion cannot be upset, namely, that they contain the first
  specimens of fiction addressed to the world at large, and widely
  circulated, in which dramatic&mdash;as distinguished from
  puppet&mdash;power is shown, and without indecorum.</p>

<p><!-- Page 196 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page196"></a>[196]</span></p>

  <p>According to some statements I have seen, but which I have not
  verified, other publishing bodies, such as the Christian Knowledge
  Society, have taken the same liberty with the names of the dead as the
  Religious Tract Society. If it be so, the impropriety is the work of the
  smaller spirits who have not been sufficiently overlooked. There must be
  an overwhelming majority in the higher councils to feel that, whenever
  <i>altered</i> works are published, <i>the fact of alteration should be
  made as prominent as the name of the author</i>. Everything short of this
  is suppression of truth, and will ultimately destroy the credit of the
  Society. Equally necessary is it that the alterations should be noted.
  When it comes to be known that the author before him is altered, he knows
  not where nor how nor by whom, the lowest reader will lose his
  interest.</p>

<p class="cenhead">A TRIBUTE TO WILLIAM FREND.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>The principles of Algebra. By William Frend.<a name="NtA_441"
  href="#Nt_441"><sup>[441]</sup></a> London, 1796, 8vo. Second Part,
  1799.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>This Algebra, says Dr. Peacock,<a name="NtA_442"
  href="#Nt_442"><sup>[442]</sup></a> shows "great distrust <!-- Page 197
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page197"></a>[197]</span>of the results
  of algebraical science which were in existence at the time when it was
  written." Truly it does; for, as Dr. Peacock had shown by full citation,
  it makes war of extermination upon all that distinguishes algebra from
  arithmetic. Robert Simson<a name="NtA_443"
  href="#Nt_443"><sup>[443]</sup></a> and Baron Maseres<a name="NtA_444"
  href="#Nt_444"><sup>[444]</sup></a> were Mr. Frend's predecessors in this
  opinion.</p>

  <p>The genuine respect which I entertained for my father-in-law did not
  prevent my canvassing with perfect freedom his anti-algebraical and
  anti-Newtonian opinions, in a long obituary memoir read at the
  Astronomical Society in February 1842, which was written by me. It was
  copied into the <i>Athenæum</i> of March 19. It must be said that if the
  manner in which algebra <i>was</i> presented to the learner had been true
  algebra, he would have been right: and if he had confined himself to
  protesting against the imposition of attraction as a fundamental part of
  the existence of matter, he would have been in unity with a great many,
  including Newton himself. I wish he had preferred amendment to rejection
  when he was a college tutor: he wrote and spoke English with a clearness
  which is seldom equaled.</p>

  <p>His anti-Newtonian discussions are confined to the preliminary
  chapters of his <i>Evening Amusements</i>,<a name="NtA_445"
  href="#Nt_445"><sup>[445]</sup></a> a series of astronomical lessons in
  nineteen volumes, following the moon through a period of the golden
  numbers.</p>

  <p>There is a mistake about him which can never be destroyed. It is
  constantly said that, at his celebrated trial in 1792, for sedition and
  opposition to the Liturgy, etc., he was <i>expelled</i> from the
  University. He was <i>banished</i>. People cannot see the difference; but
  it made all the difference to <!-- Page 198 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page198"></a>[198]</span>Mr. Frend. He held his fellowship and its
  profits till his marriage in 1808, and was a member of the University and
  of its Senate till his death in 1841, as any Cambridge Calendar up to
  1841 will show. That they would have expelled him if they could, is
  perfectly true; and there is a funny story&mdash;also perfectly
  true&mdash;about their first proceedings being under a statute which
  would have given the power, had it not been discovered during the
  proceedings that the statute did not exist. It had come so near to
  existence as to be entered into the Vice-Chancellor's book for his
  signature, which it wanted, as was not seen till Mr. Frend exposed it: in
  fact, the statute had never actually passed.</p>

  <p>There is an absurd mistake in Gunning's<a name="NtA_446"
  href="#Nt_446"><sup>[446]</sup></a> <i>Reminiscences of Cambridge</i>. In
  quoting a passage of Mr. Frend's pamphlet, which was very obnoxious to
  the existing Government, it is printed that the poor market-women
  complained that they were to be <i>scotched</i> a quarter of their wages
  by taxation; and attention is called to the word by its being three times
  printed in italics. In the pamphlet it is "sconced"; that very common old
  word for fined or mulcted.</p>

  <p>Lord Lyndhurst,<a name="NtA_447" href="#Nt_447"><sup>[447]</sup></a>
  who has [1863] just passed away under a load of years and honors, was Mr.
  Frend's private pupil at Cambridge. At the time of the celebrated trial,
  he and two others amused themselves, and vented the feeling which was
  very strong among the undergraduates, by chalking the walls of Cambridge
  with "Frend for ever!" While thus engaged in what, using the term
  legally, we are probably to call his first publication, he and his
  friends were surprised by the proctors. Flight and chase followed of
  course: Copley and one of the others, Serjeant Rough,<a name="NtA_448"
  href="#Nt_448"><sup>[448]</sup></a> escaped: the <!-- Page 199 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page199"></a>[199]</span>third, whose name I
  forget, but who afterwards, I have been told was a bishop,<a
  name="NtA_449" href="#Nt_449"><sup>[449]</sup></a> being lame, was
  captured and impositioned. Looking at the Cambridge Calendar to verify
  the fact that Copley was an undergraduate at the time, I find that there
  are but two other men in the list of honors of his year whose names are
  now widely remembered. And they were both celebrated schoolmasters;
  Butler<a name="NtA_450" href="#Nt_450"><sup>[450]</sup></a> of Harrow,
  and Tate<a name="NtA_451" href="#Nt_451"><sup>[451]</sup></a> of
  Richmond.</p>

  <p>But Mr. Frend had another noted pupil. I once had a conversation with
  a very remarkable man, who was generally called "Place,<a name="NtA_452"
  href="#Nt_452"><sup>[452]</sup></a> the tailor," but who was politician,
  political economist, etc., etc. He sat in the room above his
  shop&mdash;he was then a thriving master tailor at Charing
  Cross&mdash;surrounded by books enough for nine, to shame a proverb. The
  blue books alone, cut up into strips, would have measured Great Britain
  for oh-no-we-never-mention-'ems, the Highlands included. I cannot find a
  biography of this worthy and able man. I happened to mention William
  Frend, and he said, "Ah! my old master, as I always call him. Many and
  many a time, and year after year, did he come in every <!-- Page 200
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page200"></a>[200]</span>now and then
  to give me instruction, while I was sitting on the board, working for my
  living, you know."</p>

  <p>Place, who really was a sound economist, is joined with Cobbett,
  because they were together at one time, and because he was, in 1800,
  etc., a great Radical. But for Cobbett he had a great contempt. He told
  me the following story. He and others were advising with Cobbett about
  the defense he was to make on a trial for seditious libel which was
  coming on. Said Place, "You must put in the letters you have received
  from Ministers, members of the Commons from the Speaker downwards, etc.,
  about your Register, and their wish to have subjects noted. You must then
  ask the jury whether a person so addressed must be considered as a common
  sower of sedition, etc. You will be acquitted; nay, if your intention
  should get about, very likely they will manage to stop proceedings."
  Cobbett was too much disturbed to listen; he walked about the room
  ejaculating "D&mdash;&mdash; the prison!" and the like. He had not the
  sense to follow the advice, and was convicted.</p>

  <p>Cobbett, to go on with the chain, was a political acrobat, ready for
  any kind of posture. A friend of mine gave me several times an account of
  a mission to him. A Tory member&mdash;those who know the old Tory world
  may look for his initials in initials of two consecutive words of "Pay
  his money with interest"&mdash;who was, of course, a political opponent,
  thought Cobbett had been hardly used, and determined to subscribe
  handsomely towards the expenses he was incurring as a candidate. My
  friend was commissioned to hand over the money&mdash;a bag of sovereigns,
  that notes might not be traced. He went into Cobbett's committee-room,
  told the patriot his errand, and put the money on the table. "And to
  whom, sir, am I indebted?" said Cobbett. "The donor," was the answer, "is
  Mr. Andrew Theophilus Smith," or some such unlikely pair of baptismals.
  "Ah!" said Cobbett, "I have known Mr. A.&nbsp;T.&nbsp;S. a long time! he was always
  a true friend of his country!" <!-- Page 201 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page201"></a>[201]</span></p>

  <p>To return to Place. He is a noted instance of the advantage of our
  jury system, which never asks a man's politics, etc. The late King of
  Hanover, when Duke of Cumberland, being unpopular, was brought under
  unjust suspicions by the suicide of his valet: he must have seduced the
  wife and murdered the husband. The charges were as absurd as those
  brought against the Englishman in the Frenchman's attempt at satirical
  verses upon him:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"The Englishman is a very bad man;</p>
      <p>He drink the beer and he steal the can:</p>
      <p>He kiss the wife and he beat the man;</p>
      <p>And the Englishman is a very G&mdash;&mdash; d&mdash;&mdash;."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>The charges were revived in a much later day, and the defense might
  have given some trouble. But Place, who had been the foreman at the
  inquest, came forward, and settled the question in a few lines. Every one
  knew that the old Radical was quite free of all disposition to suppress
  truth from wish to curry favor with royalty.</p>

  <p>John Speed,<a name="NtA_453" href="#Nt_453"><sup>[453]</sup></a> the
  author of the <i>English History</i>,<a name="NtA_454"
  href="#Nt_454"><sup>[454]</sup></a> (1632) which Bishop Nicolson<a
  name="NtA_455" href="#Nt_455"><sup>[455]</sup></a> calls the best
  chronicle extant, was a man, like Place, of no education, but what he
  gave himself. The bishop says he would have done better if he had a
  better training: but what, he adds, could have been expected from a
  tailor! This Speed was, as well as Place. But he was <!-- Page 202
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page202"></a>[202]</span>released from
  manual labor by Sir Fulk Grevil,<a name="NtA_456"
  href="#Nt_456"><sup>[456]</sup></a> who enabled him to study.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="cenhead">A STORY ON SIMSON.</p>

  <p>I have elsewhere noticed that those who oppose the mysteries of
  algebra do not ridicule them; this I want the cyclometers to do. Of the
  three who wrote against the great point, the negative quantity, and the
  uses of 0 which are connected with it, only one could fire a squib. That
  Robert Simson<a name="NtA_457" href="#Nt_457"><sup>[457]</sup></a> should
  do such a thing will be judged impossible by all who admit tradition. I
  do not vouch for the following; I give it as a proof of the impression
  which prevailed about him:</p>

  <p>He used to sit at his open window on the ground floor, as deep in
  geometry as a Robert Simson ought to be. Here he would be accosted by
  beggars, to whom he generally gave a trifle, he roused himself to hear a
  few words of the story, made his donation, and instantly dropped down
  into his depths. Some wags one day stopped a mendicant who was on his way
  to the window with "Now, my man, do as we tell you, and you will get
  something from that gentleman, and a shilling from us besides. You will
  go and say you are in distress, he will ask you who you are, and you will
  say you are Robert Simson, son of John Simson of Kirktonhill." The man
  did as he was told; Simson quietly gave him a coin, and dropped off. The
  wags watched a little, and saw him rouse himself again, and exclaim
  "Robert Simson, son of John Simson of Kirktonhill! why, that is myself.
  That man must be an impostor." Lord Brougham tells the same story, with
  some difference of details.</p>

<p><!-- Page 203 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page203"></a>[203]</span></p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="cenhead">BARON MASERES.</p>

  <p>Baron Maseres<a name="NtA_458" href="#Nt_458"><sup>[458]</sup></a>
  was, as a writer, dry; those who knew his writings will feel that he
  seldom could have taken in a joke or issued a pun. Maseres was the fourth
  wrangler of 1752, and first Chancellor's medallist (or highest in
  classics); his second was Porteus<a name="NtA_459"
  href="#Nt_459"><sup>[459]</sup></a> (afterward Bishop of London).
  Waring<a name="NtA_460" href="#Nt_460"><sup>[460]</sup></a> came five
  years after him: he could not get Maseres through the second page of his
  first book on algebra; a negative quantity stood like a lion in the way.
  In 1758 he published his <i>Dissertation on the Use of the Negative
  Sign</i>,<a name="NtA_461" href="#Nt_461"><sup>[461]</sup></a> 4to. There
  are some who care little about + and -, who would give it house-room for
  the sake of the four words "Printed by Samuel Richardson."</p>

  <p>Maseres speaks as follows: "A single quantity can never be marked with
  either of those signs, or considered as either affirmative or negative;
  for if any single quantity, as <i>b</i>, is marked either with the sign +
  or with the sign - without assigning some other quantity, as <i>a</i>, to
  which it is to be added, or from which it is to be subtracted, the mark
  will have no meaning or signification: thus if it be said that the square
  of -5, or the product of -5 into -5, is equal to +25, such an assertion
  must either signify no more than that 5 times 5 is equal to 25 without
  any regard to the signs, or it must be mere nonsense and unintelligible
  jargon. I speak according to the foregoing definition, by which the
  affirmativeness or negativeness of any quantity implies a relation to
  another quantity of the same kind to which it <!-- Page 204 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page204"></a>[204]</span>is added, or from which
  it is subtracted; for it may perhaps be very clear and intelligible to
  those who have formed to themselves some other idea of affirmative and
  negative quantities different from that above defined."</p>

  <p>Nothing can be more correct, or more identically logical: +5 and -5,
  standing alone, are jargon if +5 and -5 are to be understood as without
  reference to another quantity. But those who have "formed to themselves
  some other idea" see meaning enough. The great difficulty of the
  opponents of algebra lay in want of power or will to see extension of
  terms. Maseres is right when he implies that extension, accompanied by
  its refusal, makes jargon. One of my paradoxers was present at a meeting
  of the Royal Society (in 1864, I think) and asked permission to make some
  remarks upon a paper. He rambled into other things, and, naming me, said
  that I had written a book in which two sides of a triangle are pronounced
  <i>equal</i> to the third.<a name="NtA_462"
  href="#Nt_462"><sup>[462]</sup></a> So they are, in the sense in which
  the word is used in complete algebra; in which A + B = C makes A, B, C,
  three sides of a triangle, and declares that going over A and B, one
  after the other, is equivalent, in change of place, to going over C at
  once. My critic, who might, if he pleased, have objected to extension,
  insisted upon reading me in unextended meaning.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, it must be said that those who wrote on the other
  idea wrote very obscurely about it and justified Des Cartes (<i>De
  Methodo</i>)<a name="NtA_463" href="#Nt_463"><sup>[463]</sup></a> when he
  said: "Algebram vero, ut solet doceri, animadverti certis regulis et
  numerandi formulis ita esse contentam, ut videatur potius ars quædam
  confusa, cujus usu ingenium quodam modo turbatur et obscuratur, quam
  scientia qua excolatur et perspicacius <!-- Page 205 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page205"></a>[205]</span>reddatur."<a
  name="NtA_464" href="#Nt_464"><sup>[464]</sup></a> Maseres wrote this
  sentence on the title of his own work, now before me; he would have made
  it his motto if he had found it earlier.</p>

  <p>There is, I believe, in Cobbett's <i>Annual Register</i>,<a
  name="NtA_465" href="#Nt_465"><sup>[465]</sup></a> an account of an
  interview between Maseres and Cobbett when in prison.</p>

  <p>The conversation of Maseres was lively, and full of serious anecdote:
  but only one attempt at humorous satire is recorded of him; it is an
  instructive one. He was born in 1731 (Dec. 15), and his father was a
  refugee. French was the language of the house, with the pronunciation of
  the time of Louis XIV. He lived until 1824 (May 19), and saw the race of
  refugees who were driven out by the first Revolution. Their pronunciation
  differed greatly from his own; and he used to amuse himself by mimicking
  them. Those who heard him and them had the two schools of pronunciation
  before them at once; a thing which seldom happens. It might even yet be
  worth while to examine the Canadian pronunciation.</p>

  <p>Maseres went as Attorney-General to Quebec; and was appointed Cursitor
  Baron of our Exchequer in 1773. There is a curious story about his
  mission to Canada, which I have heard as good tradition, but have never
  seen in print. The reader shall have it as cheap as I; and I confess I
  rather believe it. Maseres was inveterately honest; he could not, at the
  bar, bear to see his own client victorious, when he knew his cause was a
  bad one. On a certain occasion he was in a cause which he knew would go
  against him if a certain case were quoted. Neither the judge nor the
  opposite counsel seemed to remember this case, and Maseres could not help
  dropping an allusion which brought it out. <!-- Page 206 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page206"></a>[206]</span>His business as a
  barrister fell off, of course. Some time after, Mr. Pitt (Chatham) wanted
  a lawyer to send to Canada on a private mission, and wanted a <i>very
  honest man</i>. Some one mentioned Maseres, and told the above story:
  Pitt saw that he had got the man he wanted. The mission was
  satisfactorily performed, and Maseres remained as Attorney-General.</p>

  <p>The <i>Doctrine of Life Annuities</i><a name="NtA_466"
  href="#Nt_466"><sup>[466]</sup></a> (4to, 726 pages, 1783) is a strange
  paradox. Its size, the heavy dissertations on the national debt, and the
  depth of algebra supposed known, put it out of the question as an
  elementary work, and it is unfitted for the higher student by its
  elaborate attempt at elementary character, shown in its rejection of
  forms derived from chances in favor of <i>the average</i>, and its
  exhibition of the separate values of the years of an annuity, as
  arithmetical illustrations. It is a climax of unsaleability,
  unreadability, and inutility. For intrinsic nullity of interest, and
  dilution of little matter with much ink, I can compare this book to
  nothing but that of Claude de St. Martin, elsewhere mentioned, or the
  lectures <i>On the Nature and Properties of Logarithms</i>, by James
  Little,<a name="NtA_467" href="#Nt_467"><sup>[467]</sup></a> Dublin,
  1830, 8vo. (254 heavy pages of many words and few symbols), a wonderful
  weight of weariness.</p>

  <p>The stock of this work on annuities, very little diminished, was given
  by the author to William Frend, who paid warehouse room for it until
  about 1835, when he consulted me as to its disposal. As no publisher
  could be found who would take it as a gift, for any purpose of sale, it
  was consigned, all but a few copies, to a buyer of waste paper.</p>

  <p>Baron Maseres's republications are well known: the <i>Scriptores
  Logarithmici</i><a name="NtA_468" href="#Nt_468"><sup>[468]</sup></a> is
  a set of valuable reprints, mixed <!-- Page 207 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page207"></a>[207]</span>with much which might
  better have entered into another collection. It is not so well known that
  there is a volume of optical reprints, <i>Scriptores Optici</i>, London,
  1823, 4to, edited for the veteran of ninety-two by Mr. Babbage<a
  name="NtA_469" href="#Nt_469"><sup>[469]</sup></a> at twenty-nine. This
  excellent volume contains James Gregory, Des Cartes, Halley, Barrow, and
  the optical writings of Huyghens, the <i>Principia</i> of the undulatory
  theory. It also contains, by the sort of whim in which such men as
  Maseres, myself, and some others are apt to indulge, a reprint of "The
  great new Art of weighing Vanity,"<a name="NtA_470"
  href="#Nt_470"><sup>[470]</sup></a> by M. Patrick Mathers, Arch-Bedel to
  the University of St. Andrews, Glasgow, 1672. Professor Sinclair,<a
  name="NtA_471" href="#Nt_471"><sup>[471]</sup></a> of Glasgow, a good man
  at clearing mines of the water which they did not want, and furnishing
  cities with water which they did want, seems to have written absurdly
  about hydrostatics, and to have attacked a certain Sanders,<a
  name="NtA_472" href="#Nt_472"><sup>[472]</sup></a> M.A. So Sanders,
  assisted by James Gregory, published a heavy bit of jocosity about him.
  This story of the authorship rested on a note made in his <!-- Page 208
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page208"></a>[208]</span>copy by Robert
  Gray, M.D.; but it has since been fully confirmed by a letter of James
  Gregory to Collins, in the Macclesfield Correspondence. "There is one
  Master Sinclair, who did write the <i>Ars Magna et Nova</i>,<a
  name="NtA_473" href="#Nt_473"><sup>[473]</sup></a> a pitiful ignorant
  fellow, who hath lately written horrid nonsense in the hydrostatics, and
  hath abused a master in the University, one Mr. Sanders, in print. This
  Mr. Sanders ... is resolved to cause the Bedel of the University to write
  against him.... We resolve to make excellent sport with him."</p>

  <p>On this I make two remarks: First, I have learned from experience that
  old notes, made in books by their possessors, are statements of high
  authority: they are almost always confirmed. I do not receive them
  without hesitation; but I believe that of all the statements about books
  which rest on one authority, there is a larger percentage of truth in the
  written word than in the printed word. Secondly, I mourn to think that
  when the New Zealander picks up his old copy of this book, and reads it
  by the associations of his own day, he may, in spite of the many
  assurances I have received that my <i>Athenæum Budget</i> was amusing,
  feel me to be as heavy as I feel James Gregory and Sanders. But he will
  see that I knew what was coming, which Gregory did not.</p>

<p class="cenhead">MR. FREND'S BURLESQUE.</p>

  <p>It was left for Mr. Frend to prove that an impugner of algebra could
  attempt ridicule. He was, in 1803, editor of a periodical <i>The
  Gentleman's Monthly Miscellany</i>, which lasted a few months.<a
  name="NtA_474" href="#Nt_474"><sup>[474]</sup></a> To this, among other
  things, he contributed the following, in burlesque of the use made of 0,
  to which he objected.<a name="NtA_475"
  href="#Nt_475"><sup>[475]</sup></a> The imitation of Rabelais, a writer
  <!-- Page 209 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page209"></a>[209]</span>in whom he delighted, is good: to those
  who have never dipped, it may give such a notion as they would not easily
  get elsewhere. The point of the satire is not so good. But in truth it is
  not easy to make pungent scoffs upon what is common sense to all mankind.
  Who can laugh with effect at six times nothing is nothing, as false or
  unintelligible? In an article intended for that undistinguishing know-0
  the "general reader," there would have been no force of satire, if
  <i>division</i> by 0 had been separated from multiplication by the
  same.</p>

  <p>I have followed the above by another squib, by the same author, on the
  English language. The satire is covertly aimed at theological
  phraseology; and any one who watches this subject will see that it is a
  very just observation that the Greek words are not boiled enough.</p>

<p class="cenhead"><span class="sc">Pantagruel's Decision</span> <i>of the</i> <span class="sc">Question</span> <i>about</i> <span class="sc">Nothing</span>.</p>

  <p>"Pantagruel determined to have a snug afternoon with Epistemon and
  Panurge. Dinner was ordered to be set in a small parlor, and a particular
  batch of Hermitage with some choice Burgundy to be drawn from a remote
  corner of the cellar upon the occasion. By way of lunch, about an hour
  before dinner, Pantagruel was composing his stomach with German sausages,
  reindeer's tongues, oysters, brawn, and half a dozen different sorts of
  English beer just come into fashion, when a most thundering knocking was
  heard at the great gate, and from the noise they expected it to announce
  the arrival at least of the First Consul, or king Gargantua. Panurge was
  sent to reconnoiter, and after a quarter of an hour's absence, returned
  with the news that the University of Pontemaca was waiting his highness's
  leisure in the great hall, to propound a question which <!-- Page 210
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page210"></a>[210]</span>had turned the
  brains of thirty-nine students, and had flung twenty-seven more into a
  high fever. With all my heart, says Pantagruel, and swallowed down three
  quarts of Burton ale; but remember, it wants but an hour of dinner time,
  and the question must be asked in as few words as possible; for I cannot
  deprive myself of the pleasure I expected to enjoy in the company of my
  good friends for a set of mad-headed masters. I wish brother John was
  here to settle these matters with the black gentry.</p>

  <p>"Having said or rather growled this, he proceeded to the hall of
  ceremony, and mounted his throne; Epistemon and Panurge standing on each
  side, but two steps below him. Then advanced to the throne the three
  beadles of the University of Pontemaca with their silver staves on their
  shoulders, and velvet caps on their heads, and they were followed by
  three times three doctors, and thrice three times three masters of art;
  for everything was done in Pontemaca by the number three, and on this
  account the address was written on parchment, one foot in breadth, and
  thrice three times thrice three feet in length. The beadles struck the
  ground with their heads and their staves three times in approaching the
  throne; the doctors struck the ground with their heads thrice three
  times, and the masters did the same thrice each time, beating the ground
  with their heads thrice three times. This was the accustomed form of
  approaching the throne, time out of mind, and it was said to be
  emblematic of the usual prostration of science to the throne of
  greatness.</p>

  <p>"The mathematical professor, after having spit, and hawked, and
  cleared his throat, and blown his nose on a handkerchief lent to him, for
  he had forgotten to bring his own, began to read the address. In this he
  was assisted by three masters of arts, one of whom, with a silver pen,
  pointed out the stops; the second with a small stick rapped his knuckles
  when he was to raise or lower his voice; and a third pulled his hair
  behind when he was to look Pantagruel in the face. Pantagruel began to
  chafe like a lion: <!-- Page 211 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page211"></a>[211]</span>he turned first on one side, then on the
  other: he listened and groaned, and groaned and listened, and was in the
  utmost cogitabundity of cogitation. His countenance began to brighten,
  when, at the end of an hour, the reader stammered out these words:</p>

  <p>"'It has therefore been most clearly proved that as all matter may be
  divided into parts infinitely smaller than the infinitely smallest part
  of the infinitesimal of nothing, so nothing has all the properties of
  something, and may become, by just and lawful right, susceptible of
  addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, squaring, and cubing:
  that it is to all intents and purposes as good as anything that has been,
  is, or can be taught in the nine universities of the land, and to deprive
  it of its rights is a most cruel innovation and usurpation, tending to
  destroy all just subordination in the world, making all universities
  superfluous, leveling vice-chancellors, doctors, and proctors, masters,
  bachelors, and scholars, to the mean and contemptible state of butchers
  and tallow-chandlers, bricklayers and chimney-sweepers, who, if it were
  not for these learned mysteries, might think that they knew as much as
  their betters. Every one then, who has the good of science at heart, must
  pray for the interference of his highness to put a stop to all the
  disputes about nothing, and by his decision to convince all gainsayers
  that the science of nothing is taught in the best manner in the
  universities, to the great edification and improvement of all the youth
  in the land.'</p>

  <p>"Here Pantagruel whispered in the ear of Panurge, who nodded to
  Epistemon, and they two left the assembly, and did not return for an
  hour, till the orator had finished his task. The three beadles had thrice
  struck the ground with their heads and staves, the <span
  class="correction" title="text reads `docters'">doctors</span> had
  finished their compliments, and the masters were making their
  twenty-seven prostrations. Epistemon and Panurge went up to Pantagruel,
  whom they found fast asleep and snoring; nor could he be roused but by as
  many tugs as there had been <!-- Page 212 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page212"></a>[212]</span>bowings from the corps of learning. At
  last he opened his eyes, gave a good stretch, made half a dozen yawns,
  and called for a stoup of wine. I thank you, my masters, says he; so
  sound a nap I have not had since I came from the island of Priestfolly.
  Have you dined, my masters? They answered the question by as many bows as
  at entrance; but his highness left them to the care of Panurge, and
  retired to the little parlor with Epistemon, where they burst into a fit
  of laughter, declaring that this learned Baragouin about nothing was just
  as intelligible as the lawyer's Galimathias. Panurge conducted the
  learned body into a large saloon, and each in his way hearing a
  clattering of plates and glasses, congratulated himself on his
  approaching good cheer. There they were left by Panurge, who took his
  chair by Pantagruel just as the soup was removed, but he made up for the
  want of that part of his dinner by a pint of champagne. The learning of
  the university had whetted their appetites; what they each ate it is
  needless to recite; good wine, good stories, and hearty laughs went
  round, and three hours elapsed before one soul of them recollected the
  hungry students of Pontemaca.</p>

  <p>"Epistemon reminded them of the business in hand, and orders were
  given for a fresh dozen of hermitage to be put upon table, and the royal
  attendants to get ready. As soon as the dozen bottles were emptied,
  Pantagruel rose from table, the royal trumpets sounded, and he was
  accompanied by the great officers of his court into the large dining
  hall, where was a table with forty-two covers. Pantagruel sat at the
  head, Epistemon at the bottom, and Panurge in the middle, opposite an
  immense silver tureen, which would hold fifty gallons of soup. The wise
  men of Pontemaca then took their seats according to seniority. Every
  countenance glistened with delight; the music struck up; the dishes were
  uncovered. Panurge had enough to do to handle the immense silver ladle:
  Pantagruel and Epistemon had no time for eating, they were fully employed
  in carving. The bill <!-- Page 213 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page213"></a>[213]</span>of fare announced the names of a hundred
  different dishes. From Panurge's ladle came into the soup plate as much
  as he took every time out of the tureen; and as it was the rule of the
  court that every one should appear to eat, as long as he sat at table,
  there was the clattering of nine and thirty spoons against the silver
  soup-plates for a quarter of an hour. They were then removed, and knives
  and forks were in motion for half an hour. Glasses were continually
  handed round in the mean time, and then everything was removed, except
  the great tureen of soup. The second course was now served up, in
  dispatching which half an hour was consumed; and at the conclusion the
  wise men of Pontemaca had just as much in their stomachs as Pantagruel in
  his head from their address: for nothing was cooked up for them in every
  possible shape that Panurge could devise.</p>

  <p>"Wine-glasses, large decanters, fruit dishes, and plates were now set
  on. Pantagruel and Epistemon alternately gave bumper toasts: the
  University of Pontemaca, the eye of the world, the mother of taste and
  good sense and universal learning, the patroness of utility, and the
  second only to Pantagruel in wisdom and virtue (for these were her
  titles), was drank standing with thrice three times three, and huzzas and
  clattering of glasses; but to such wine the wise men of Pontemaca had not
  been accustomed; and though Pantagruel did not suffer one to rise from
  table till the eighty-first glass had been emptied, not even the weakest
  headed master of arts felt his head in the least indisposed. The
  decanters indeed were often removed, but they were brought back
  replenished, filled always with nothing.</p>

  <p>"Silence was now proclaimed, and in a trice Panurge leaped into the
  large silver tureen. Thence he made his bows to Pantagruel and the whole
  company, and commenced an oration of signs, which lasted an hour and a
  half, and in which he went over all the matter contained in the Pontemaca
  address; and though the wise men looked very serious during the whole
  time, Pantagruel himself and his whole <!-- Page 214 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page214"></a>[214]</span>court could not help
  indulging in repeated bursts of laughter. It was universally acknowledged
  that he excelled himself, and that the arguments by which he beat the
  English masters of arts at Paris were nothing to the exquisite selection
  of attitudes which he this day assumed. The greatest shouts of applause
  were excited when he was running thrice round the tureen on its rim, with
  his left hand holding his nose, and the other exercising itself nine and
  thirty times on his back. In this attitude he concluded with his back to
  the professor of mathematics; and at the instant he gave his last flap,
  by a sudden jump, and turning heels over head in the air, he presented
  himself face to face to the professor, and standing on his left leg, with
  his left hand holding his nose, he presented to him, in a white satin
  bag, Pantagruel's royal decree. Then advancing his right leg, he fixed it
  on the professor's head, and after three turns, in which he clapped his
  sides with both hands thrice three times, down he leaped, and Pantagruel,
  Epistemon, and himself took their leaves of the wise men of
  Pontemaca.</p>

  <p>"The wise men now retired, and by royal orders were accompanied by a
  guard, and according to the etiquette of the court, no one having a royal
  order could stop at any public house till it was delivered. The
  procession arrived at Pontemaca at nine o'clock the next morning, and the
  sound of bells from every church and college announced their arrival. The
  congregation was assembled; the royal decree was saluted in the same
  manner as if his highness had been there in person; and after the proper
  ceremonies had been performed, the satin bag was opened exactly at twelve
  o'clock. A finely emblazoned roll was drawn forth, and the public orator
  read to the gaping assembly the following words:</p>

  <p>"'They who can make something out of nothing shall have nothing to eat
  at the court of&mdash;<span class="sc">Pantagruel</span>.'" <!-- Page 215
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page215"></a>[215]</span></p>

<p class="cenhead"><span class="sc">Origin</span> <i>of the</i> <span class="sc">English Language</span>, <i>related by a</i> <span class="sc">Swede</span>.</p>

  <p>"Some months ago in a party in Holland, consisting of natives of
  various countries, the merit of their respective languages became a topic
  of conversation. A Swede, who had been a great traveler, and could
  converse in most of the modern languages of Europe, laughed very heartily
  at an Englishman, who had ventured to speak in praise of the tongue of
  his dear country. I never had any trouble, says he, in learning English.
  To my very great surprise, the moment I sat foot on shore at Gravesend, I
  found out, that I could understand, with very little trouble, every word
  that was said. It was a mere jargon, made up of German, French, and
  Italian, with now and then a word from the Spanish, Latin or Greek. I had
  only to bring my mouth to their mode of speaking, which was done with
  ease in less than a week, and I was everywhere taken for a true-born
  Englishman; a privilege by the way of no small importance in a country,
  where each man, God knows why, thinks his foggy island superior to any
  other part of the world: and though his door is never free from some dun
  or other coming for a tax, and if he steps out of it he is sure to be
  knocked down or to have his pocket picked, yet he has the insolence to
  think every foreigner a miserable slave, and his country the seat of
  everything wretched. They may talk of liberty as they please, but Spain
  or Turkey for my money: barring the bowstring and the inquisition, they
  are the most comfortable countries under heaven, and you need not be
  afraid of either, if you do not talk of religion and politics. I do not
  see much difference too in this respect in England, for when I was there,
  one of their most eminent men for learning was put in prison for a couple
  of years, and got his death for translating one of Æsop's fables into
  English, which every child in Spain and Turkey is taught, as soon as he
  comes out of his leading strings. Here all the company unanimously cried
  out against the Swede, that it was <!-- Page 216 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page216"></a>[216]</span>impossible: for in
  England, the land of liberty, the only thing its worst enemies could say
  against it, was, that they paid for their liberty a much greater price
  than it was worth.&mdash;Every man there had a fair trial according to
  laws, which everybody could understand; and the judges were cool,
  patient, discerning men, who never took the part of the crown against the
  prisoner, but gave him every assistance possible for his defense.</p>

  <p>"The Swede was borne down, but not convinced; and he seemed determined
  to spit out all his venom. Well, says he, at any rate you will not deny
  that the English have not got a language of their own, and that they came
  by it in a very odd way. Of this at least I am certain, for the whole
  history was related to me by a witch in Lapland, whilst I was bargaining
  for a wind. Here the company were all in unison again for the story.</p>

  <p>"In ancient times, said the old hag, the English occupied a spot in
  Tartary, where they lived sulkily by themselves, unknowing and unknown.
  By a great convulsion that took place in China, the inhabitants of that
  and the adjoining parts of Tartary were driven from their seats, and
  after various wanderings took up their abode in Germany. During this time
  nobody could understand the English, for they did not talk, but hissed
  like so many snakes. The poor people felt uneasy under this circumstance,
  and in one of their parliaments, or rather hissing meetings, it was
  determined to seek a remedy: and an embassy was sent to some of our
  sisterhood then living on Mount Hecla. They were put to a nonplus, and
  summoned the Devil to their relief. To him the English presented their
  petitions, and explained their sad case; and he, upon certain conditions,
  promised to befriend them, and to give them a language. The poor Devil
  was little aware of what he had promised; but he is, as all the world
  knows, a man of too much honor to break his word. Up and down the world
  then he went in quest of this new language: visited all the universities,
  and all <!-- Page 217 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page217"></a>[217]</span>the schools, and all the courts of law,
  and all the play-houses, and all the prisons; never was poor devil so
  fagged. It would have made your heart bleed to see him. Thrice did he go
  round the earth in every parallel of latitude; and at last, wearied and
  jaded out, back came he to Hecla in despair, and would have thrown
  himself into the volcano, if he had been made of combustible materials.
  Luckily at that time our sisters were engaged in settling the balance of
  Europe; and whilst they were looking over projects, and counter-projects,
  and ultimatums, and post ultimatums, the poor Devil, unable to assist
  them was groaning in a corner and ruminating over his sad condition.</p>

  <p>"On a sudden, a hellish joy overspread his countenance; up he jumped,
  and, like Archimedes of old, ran like a madman amongst the throng,
  turning over tables, and papers, and witches, roaring out for a full hour
  together nothing else but 'tis found, 'tis found! Away were sent the
  sisterhood in every direction, some to traverse all the corners of the
  earth, and others to prepare a larger caldron than had ever yet been set
  upon Hecla. The affairs of Europe were at a stand: its balance was thrown
  aside; prime ministers and ambassadors were everywhere in the utmost
  confusion; and, by the way, they have never been able to find the balance
  since that time, and all the fine speeches upon the subject, with which
  your newspapers are every now and then filled, are all mere hocus-pocus
  and rhodomontade. However, the caldron was soon set on, and the air was
  darkened by witches riding on broomsticks, bringing a couple of folios
  under each arm, and across each shoulder. I remember the time exactly: it
  was just as the council of Nice had broken up, so that they got books and
  papers there dog cheap; but it was a bad thing for the poor English, as
  these were the worst materials that entered into the caldron. Besides, as
  the Devil wanted some amusement, and had not seen an account of the
  transactions of this famous council, he had all the books brought from it
  laid before him, and split his sides almost <!-- Page 218 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page218"></a>[218]</span>with laughing, whilst
  he was reading the speeches and decrees of so many of his old friends and
  acquaintances. All this while the witches were depositing their loads in
  the great caldron. There were books from the Dalai Lama, and from China:
  there were books from the Hindoos, and tallies from the Caffres: there
  were paintings from Mexico, and rocks of hieroglyphics from Egypt: the
  last country supplied besides the swathings of two thousand mummies, and
  four-fifths of the famed library of Alexandria. Bubble! bubble! toil and
  trouble! never was a day of more labor and anxiety; and if our good
  master had but flung in the Greek books at the proper time, they would
  have made a complete job of it. He was a little too impatient: as the
  caldron frothed up, he skimmed it off with a great ladle, and filled some
  thousands of our wind-bags with the froth, which the English with great
  joy carried back to their own country. These bags were sent to every
  district: the chiefs first took their fill, and then the common people;
  hence they now speak a language which no foreigner can understand, unless
  he has learned half a dozen other languages; and the poor people, not one
  in ten, understand a third part of what is said to them. The hissing,
  however, they have not entirely got rid of, and every seven years, when
  the Devil, according to agreement, pays them a visit, they entertain him
  at their common halls and county meetings with their original
  language.</p>

  <p>"The good-natured old hag told me several other circumstances,
  relative to this curious transaction, which, as there is an Englishman in
  company, it will be prudent to pass over in silence: but I cannot help
  mentioning one thing which she told me as a very great secret. You know,
  says she to me, that the English have more religions among them than any
  other nation in Europe, and that there is more teaching and sermonizing
  with them than in any other country. The fact is this; it matters not who
  gets up to teach them, the hard words of the Greek were not sufficiently
  <!-- Page 219 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page219"></a>[219]</span>boiled, and whenever they get into a
  sentence, the poor people's brains are turned, and they know no more what
  the preacher is talking about, than if he harangued them in Arabic. Take
  my word for it if you please; but if not, when you get to England, desire
  the bettermost sort of people that you are acquainted with to read to you
  an act of parliament, which of course is written in the clearest and
  plainest style in which anything can be written, and you will find that
  not one in ten will be able to make tolerable sense of it. The language
  would have been an excellent language, if it had not been for the council
  of Nice, and the words had been well boiled.</p>

  <p>"Here the company burst out into a fit of laughter. The Englishman got
  up and shook hands with the Swede: <i>si non è vero</i>, said he, <i>è
  ben trovato</i>.<a name="NtA_476" href="#Nt_476"><sup>[476]</sup></a>
  But, however I may laugh at it here, I would not advise you to tell this
  story on the other side of the water. So here's a bumper to Old England

  his certificate of this, calls the author sixteen years of age, and does
  not strive to exaggerate the wonder, as he might have done, by reminding
  his readers that this work, of original and sustained mathematical
  investigation, must have been coming from the pen at the ages of fourteen
  and fifteen. The truth was, as attested by De Molières,<a name="NtA_480"
  href="#Nt_480"><sup>[480]</sup></a> Clairaut had given public proofs of
  his power at twelve years old. His age being thus publicly certified, all
  doubt is removed: say he had been&mdash;though great wonder would still
  have been left&mdash;twenty-one instead of sixteen, his appearance, and
  the remembrances of his friends, schoolfellows, etc., would have made it
  utterly hopeless to knock off five years of that age while he was on view
  in Paris as a young lion. De Molières, who examined the work officially
  for the <i>Garde des Sceaux</i>, is transported beyond the bounds of
  official gravity, and says that it "ne mérite pas seulement d'être
  imprimé, mais d'être admiré comme un prodige d'imagination, de
  conception, et de capacité."<a name="NtA_481"

  <p>That Blaise Pascal was born in June, 1623, is perfectly well
  established and uncontested.<a name="NtA_482"
  href="#Nt_482"><sup>[482]</sup></a> That he wrote his conic sections at
  the age of sixteen might be difficult to establish, though tolerably well
  attested, if it were not for <!-- Page 221 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page221"></a>[221]</span>one circumstance, for the book was not
  published. The celebrated theorem, "Pascal's hexagram,"<a name="NtA_483"
  href="#Nt_483"><sup>[483]</sup></a> makes all the rest come very easy.
  Now Curabelle,<a name="NtA_484" href="#Nt_484"><sup>[484]</sup></a> in a
  work published in 1644, sneers at Desargues,<a name="NtA_485"
  href="#Nt_485"><sup>[485]</sup></a> whom he quotes, for having, in 1642,
  deferred a discussion until "cette grande proposition nommée le Pascale
  verra le jour."<a name="NtA_486" href="#Nt_486"><sup>[486]</sup></a> That
  is, by the time Pascal was nineteen, the <i>hexagram</i> was circulating
  under a name derived from the author. The common story about Pascal,
  given by his sister,<a name="NtA_487" href="#Nt_487"><sup>[487]</sup></a>
  is an absurdity which no doubt has prejudiced many against tales of early
  proficiency. He is made, when quite a boy, to invent geometry <i>in the
  order of Euclid's propositions</i>: as if that order were natural
  sequence of investigation. The hexagram at ten years old would be a
  hundred times less unlikely.</p>

  <p>The instances named are painfully astonishing: I give one which has
  fallen out of sight, because it will preserve an imperfect biography.
  John Wilson<a name="NtA_488" href="#Nt_488"><sup>[488]</sup></a> is
  Wilson of that <!-- Page 222 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page222"></a>[222]</span>Ilk, that is, of "Wilson's Theorem." It is
  this: if <i>p</i> be a prime number, the product of all the numbers up to
  <i>p</i>-1, increased by 1, is divisible without remainder by <i>p</i>.
  All mathematicians know this as Wilson's theorem, but few know who Wilson
  was. He was born August 6, 1741, at the Howe in Applethwaite, and he was
  heir to a small estate at Troutbeck in Westmoreland. He was sent to
  Peterhouse, at Cambridge, and while an undergraduate was considered
  stronger in algebra than any one in the University, except Professor
  Waring, one of the most powerful algebraists of the century.<a
  name="NtA_489" href="#Nt_489"><sup>[489]</sup></a> He was the senior
  wrangler of 1761, and was then for some time a private tutor. When
  Paley,<a name="NtA_490" href="#Nt_490"><sup>[490]</sup></a> then in his
  third year, determined to make a push for the senior wranglership, which
  he got, Wilson was recommended to him as a tutor. Both were ardent in
  their work, except that sometimes Paley, when he came for his lesson,
  would find "Gone a fishing" written on his tutor's outer door: which was
  insult added to injury, for Paley was very fond of fishing. Wilson soon
  left Cambridge, and went to the bar. He practised on the northern circuit
  with great success; and, one day, while passing his vacation on his
  little property at Troutbeck, he received information, to his great
  surprise, that Lord Thurlow,<a name="NtA_491"
  href="#Nt_491"><sup>[491]</sup></a> with whom he had <!-- Page 223
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page223"></a>[223]</span>no
  acquaintance, had recommended him to be a Judge of the Court of Common
  Pleas. He died, Oct. 18, 1793, with a very high reputation as a lawyer
  and a Judge. These facts are partly from Meadley's <i>Life of
  Paley</i>,<a name="NtA_492" href="#Nt_492"><sup>[492]</sup></a> no doubt
  from Paley himself, partly from the <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i>, and from
  an epitaph written by Bishop Watson.<a name="NtA_493"
  href="#Nt_493"><sup>[493]</sup></a> Wilson did not publish anything: the
  theorem by which he has cut his name in the theory of numbers was
  communicated to Waring, by whom it was published. He married, in 1788, a
  daughter of Serjeant Adair,<a name="NtA_494"
  href="#Nt_494"><sup>[494]</sup></a> and left issue. <i>Had a family</i>,
  many will say: but a man and his wife are a family, even without
  children. An actuary may be allowed to be accurate in this matter, of
  which I was reminded by what an actuary wrote of another actuary. William
  Morgan,<a name="NtA_495" href="#Nt_495"><sup>[495]</sup></a> in the life
  of his uncle Dr. Richard Price,<a name="NtA_496"
  href="#Nt_496"><sup>[496]</sup></a> says that the Doctor and his <!--
  Page 224 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page224"></a>[224]</span>wife
  were "never blessed with an addition to their family." I never met with
  such accuracy elsewhere. Of William Morgan I add that my surname and
  pursuits have sometimes, to my credit be it said, made a confusion
  between him and me. Dates are nothing to the mistaken; the last three
  years of Morgan's life were the first three years of my actuary-life
  (1830-33). The mistake was to my advantage as well as to my credit. I owe
  to it the acquaintance of one of the noblest of the human race, I mean
  Elizabeth Fry,<a name="NtA_497" href="#Nt_497"><sup>[497]</sup></a> who
  came to me for advice about a philanthropic design, which involved life
  questions, under a general impression that some Morgan had attended to
  such things.<a name="NtA_498" href="#Nt_498"><sup>[498]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Mr. Palmer burned some tobacco with a burning glass, saw that a lens

  <p>"If we admit that the sun could be removed, and a terrestrial body of
  ice placed in its stead, it would produce the same effect. The sun is a
  crystaline body receiving the radiance of God, and operates on this earth
  in a similar manner as the light of the sun does when applied to a convex
  mirror or glass."</p>

  <p>Nov. 10, 1801. The Rev. Thomas Cormouls,<a name="NtA_500"
  href="#Nt_500"><sup>[500]</sup></a> minister of Tettenhall, addressed a
  letter to Sir Wm. Herschel, from which I extract the following:</p>

  <p>"Here it may be asked, then, how came the doctrines of Newton to solve
  all astronomic Phenomina, and all problems concerning the same, both <i>a
  parte ante</i> and <i>a parte post</i>.<a name="NtA_501"
  href="#Nt_501"><sup>[501]</sup></a> It is answered that he certainly
  wrought the principles he made use of into strickt analogy with the real
  Phenomina of the heavens, and that the rules and results arizing from
  them <!-- Page 226 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page226"></a>[226]</span>agree with them and resolve accurately all
  questions concerning them. Though they are not fact and true, or nature,
  but analogous to it, in the manner of the artificial numbers of
  logarithms, sines, &amp;c. A very important question arises here, Did
  Newton mean to impose upon the world? By no means: he received and used
  the doctrines reddy formed; he did a little extend and contract his
  principles when wanted, and commit a few oversights of consequences. But
  when he was very much advanced in life, he suspected the fundamental
  nullity of them: but I have from a certain anecdote strong ground to
  believe that he knew it before his decease and intended to have retracted
  his error. But, however, somebody did deceive, if not wilfully,
  negligently at least. That was a man to whom the world has great
  obligations too. It was no less a philosopher than Galileo."</p>

  <p>That Newton wanted to retract before his death, is a notion not
  uncommon among paradoxers. Nevertheless, there is no retraction in the
  third edition of the <i>Principia</i>, published when Newton was
  eighty-four years old! The moral of the above is, that a gentleman who
  prefers instructing William Herschel to learning how to spell, may find a
  proper niche in a proper place, for warning to others. It seems that
  gravitation is not truth, but only the logarithm of it.</p>

  Wilkins<a name="NtA_502" href="#Nt_502"><sup>[502]</sup></a>.... In two

</blockquote>

  <p>This work, or at least part of the edition&mdash;all for aught I
  know&mdash;is printed on wood; that is, on paper made from wood-pulp. It
  has a rough surface; and when held before a candle is of very unequal
  transparency. There is in it a reprint of the works on the earth and
  moon. The discourse on the possibility of going to the moon, in this and
  the edition of 1640, is incorporated: but from the account in the <!--
  Page 227 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page227"></a>[227]</span>life
  prefixed, and a mention by D'Israeli, I should suppose that it had
  originally a separate title-page, and some circulation as a separate
  tract. Wilkins treats this subject half seriously, half jocosely; he has
  evidently not quite made up his mind. He is clear that "arts are not yet
  come to their solstice," and that posterity will bring hidden things to
  light. As to the difficulty of carrying food, he thinks, scoffing Puritan
  that he is, the Papists may be trained to fast the voyage, or may find
  the bread of their Eucharist "serve well enough for their
  <i>viaticum</i>."<a name="NtA_503" href="#Nt_503"><sup>[503]</sup></a> He
  also puts the case that the story of Domingo Gonsales may be realized,
  namely, that wild geese find their way to the moon. It will be
  remembered&mdash;to use the usual substitute for, It has been
  forgotten&mdash;that the posthumous work of Bishop Francis Godwin<a
  name="NtA_504" href="#Nt_504"><sup>[504]</sup></a> of Llandaff was
  published in 1638, the very year of Wilkins's first edition, in time for
  him to mention it at the end. Godwin makes Domingo Gonsales get to the
  moon in a chariot drawn by wild geese, and, as old books would say,
  discourses fully on that head. It is not a little amusing that Wilkins
  should have been seriously accused of plagiarizing Godwin, Wilkins
  writing in earnest, or nearly so, and Godwin writing fiction. It may
  serve to show philosophers how very near pure speculation comes to fable.
  From the sublime to the ridiculous is but a step: which is the sublime,
  and which the ridiculous, every one must settle for himself. With me,
  good fiction is the sublime, and bad speculation the ridiculous. The
  number of bishops in my list is small. I might, had I possessed the book,
  have opened the list of quadrators with an Archbishop of Canterbury, or
  at least with a divine who was not wholly not archbishop. Thomas
  Bradwardine<a name="NtA_505" href="#Nt_505"><sup>[505]</sup></a>

  1349, and lived five weeks longer, dying, I suppose, unconfirmed and
  unconsecrated.<a name="NtA_506" href="#Nt_506"><sup>[506]</sup></a>
  Leland says he held the see a year, <i>unus tantum annulus</i>,<a

  year. He squared the circle, and his performance was printed at Paris in
  1494. I have never seen it, nor any work of the author, except a tract on

  very justly. There is a curious phrase which occurs more than once. When
  he wants to say that something or other was done before Simson or another
  was born, he says "before he existed, at least as an author." He seems to
  reserve the possibility of Simson's <i>pre-existence</i>, but at the same
  time to assume that he never wrote anything in his previous state. Tell

  of velocities of the two sides of the earth, arising from the composition
  of the rotation and the orbital motion. The <i>paradox</i> is a fair one,
  and deserving of investigation; but, perhaps it would not be easy to
  deduce from it tides, trade-winds, aerolithes, &amp;c., as Mr. Wood
  thought he had done in a work from which he gives an extract, and which
  he describes as published. The composition of rotations, &amp;c., is not
  for the world at large: the paradox of the non-rotation of the moon about
  her axis is an instance. How many persons know that when a wheel rolls on
  the ground, the lowest point is moving upwards, the highest point
  forwards, and the intermediate points in all degrees of betwixt and
  between? This is too short an explanation, with some good
  difficulties.</p>

  <p>The Rev. William Jones, above mentioned (1726-1800), the friend and
  biographer of Bishop Horne and his stout <!-- Page 238 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page238"></a>[238]</span>defender, is best known
  as William Jones of Nayland, who (1757)<a name="NtA_545"
  href="#Nt_545"><sup>[545]</sup></a> published the <i>Catholic Doctrine of
  the Trinity</i>; he was also strong for the Hutchinsonian physical
  trinity of fire, light, and spirit. This well-known work was generally
  recommended, as the defence of the orthodox system, to those who could
  not go into the learning of the subject. There is now a work more suited
  to our time: <i>The Rock of Ages</i>, by the Rev. E.&nbsp;H. Bickersteth,<a
  name="NtA_546" href="#Nt_546"><sup>[546]</sup></a> now published by the
  Religious Tract Society, without date, answered by the Rev. Dr. Sadler,<a
  name="NtA_547" href="#Nt_547"><sup>[547]</sup></a> in a work (1859)
  entitled <i>Gloria Patri</i>, in which, says Mr. Bickersteth, "the author
  has not even attempted to grapple with my main propositions." I have read
  largely on the controversy, and I think I know what this means. Moreover,
  when I see the note "There are two other passages to which Unitarians
  sometimes refer, but the deduction they draw from them is, in each case,
  refuted by the context"&mdash;I think I see why the two texts are not
  named. Nevertheless, the author is a little more disposed to yield to
  criticism than his foregoers; he does not insist on texts and readings
  which the greatest editors have rejected. And he writes with courtesy,
  both direct and oblique, towards his antagonists; which, on his side of
  this subject, is like letting in fresh air. So that I suspect the two
  books will together make a tolerably good introduction to the subject for
  those who cannot go deep. Mr. Bickersteth's book is well arranged and
  indexed, which is a point of superiority to Jones of Nayland. There is a
  point which I should gravely recommend to writers on the orthodox side.
  The Unitarians in <!-- Page 239 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page239"></a>[239]</span>England have frequently contended that the
  method of proving the divinity of Jesus Christ from the New Testament
  would equally prove the divinity of Moses. I have not fallen in the way
  of any orthodox answers specially directed at the repeated tracts written
  by Unitarians in proof of their assertion. If there be any, they should
  be more known; if there be none, some should be written. Which ever side
  may be right, the treatment of this point would be indeed coming to close
  quarters. The heterodox assertion was first supported, it is said, by
  John Bidle or Biddle (1615-1662) of Magdalen College, Oxford, the
  earliest of the English Unitarian writers, previously known by a
  translation of part of Virgil and part of Juvenal.<a name="NtA_548"
  href="#Nt_548"><sup>[548]</sup></a> But I cannot find that he wrote on
  it.<a name="NtA_549" href="#Nt_549"><sup>[549]</sup></a> It is the
  subject of "<span title="haireseôn anastasis" class="grk"

  "Six more letters to Granville Sharp, Esq., ... By Gregory Blunt, Esq."
  London, 8vo., 1803.<a name="NtA_551" href="#Nt_551"><sup>[551]</sup></a>
  This much I can confidently say, that the study of these tracts would
  prevent orthodox writers from some curious slips, which are slips obvious
  to all sides of opinion. The lower defenders of orthodoxy frequently vex
  the spirits of the higher ones.</p>

  <p>Since writing the above I have procured Dr. Sadler's answer. I thought
  I knew what the challenger meant when he said the respondent had not
  grappled with his main <!-- Page 240 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page240"></a>[240]</span>propositions. I should say that he is
  clung on to from beginning to end. But perhaps Mr. B. has his own meaning
  of logical terms, such as "proposition": he certainly has his own meaning
  of "cumulative." He says his evidence is cumulative; not a catena, the
  strength of which is in its weakest part, but distinct and independent
  lines, each of which corroborates the other. This is the very opposite of
  <i>cumulative</i>: it is <i>distributive</i>. When different arguments
  are each necessary to a conclusion, the evidence is <i>cumulative</i>;
  when any one will do, even though they strengthen each other, it is
  <i>distributive</i>. The word "cumulative" is a synonym of the law word
  "constructive"; a whole which will do made out of parts which separately
  will not. Lord Strafford <a name="NtA_552"
  href="#Nt_552"><sup>[552]</sup></a> opens his defence with the use of
  both words: "They have invented a kind of <i>accumulated</i> or
  <i>constructive</i> evidence; by which many actions, either totally
  innocent in themselves, or criminal in a much inferior degree, shall,
  when united, <i>amount</i> to treason." The conclusion is, that Mr. B. is
  a Cambridge man; the Oxford men do not confuse the elementary terms of
  logic. O dear old Cambridge! when the New Zealander comes let him find
  among the relics of your later sons some proof of attention to the
  elementary laws of thought. A little-go of logic, please!</p>

  <p>Mr. B., though apparently not a Hutchinsonian, has a nibble at a
  physical Trinity. "If, as we gaze on the sun shining in the firmament, we
  see any faint adumbration of the doctrine of the Trinity in the fontal
  orb, the light ever generated, and the heat proceeding from the sun and
  its beams&mdash;threefold and yet one, the sun, its light, and its <!--
  Page 241 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page241"></a>[241]</span>heat,&mdash;that luminous globe, and the
  radiance ever flowing from it, are both evident to the eye; but the vital
  warmth is felt, not seen, and is only manifested in the life it
  transfuses through creation. The proof of its real existence is
  self-demonstrating."</p>

  <p>We shall see how Revilo<a name="NtA_553"
  href="#Nt_553"><sup>[553]</sup></a> illustrates orthodoxy by mathematics.
  It was my duty to have found one of the many illustrations from physics;
  but perhaps I should have forgotten it if this instance had not come in
  my way. It is very bad physics. The sun, apart from its light, evident to
  the eye! Heat more self-demonstrating than light, because <i>felt</i>!
  Heat only manifested by the life it diffuses! Light implied not necessary
  to life! But the theology is worse than Sabellianism<a name="NtA_554"
  href="#Nt_554"><sup>[554]</sup></a>. To adumbrate&mdash;i.e., make a
  picture of&mdash;the orthodox doctrine, the sun must be heavenly body,
  the light heavenly body, the heat heavenly body; and yet, not three
  heavenly bodies, but one heavenly body. The truth is, that this
  illustration and many others most strikingly illustrate the Trinity of
  fundamental doctrine held by the Unitarians, in all its differences from
  the Trinity of persons held by the Orthodox. Be right which may, the
  right or wrong of the Unitarians shines out in the comparison. Dr. Sadler
  confirms me&mdash;by which I mean that I wrote the above before I saw
  what he says&mdash;in the following words: "The sun is one object with
  two <i>properties</i>, and these properties have a parallel not in the
  second and third persons of the Trinity, but in the attributes of
  Deity."</p>

  <p>The letting light alone, as self-evident, and making heat
  self-demonstrating, because felt&mdash;i.e., perceptible now and
  then&mdash;has the character of the Irishman's astronomy:</p>

<p class="cenhead">SIR RICHARD PHILLIPS.</p>

  <p><i>Sir Richard Phillips</i><a name="NtA_555"
  href="#Nt_555"><sup>[555]</sup></a> (born 1768) was conspicuous in 1793,
  when he was sentenced to a year's imprisonment<a name="NtA_556"
  href="#Nt_556"><sup>[556]</sup></a> for selling Paine's <i>Rights of
  Man</i>; and again when, in 1807<a name="NtA_557"
  href="#Nt_557"><sup>[557]</sup></a>, he was knighted as Sheriff of
  London. As a bookseller, he was able to enforce his opinions in more ways
  than others. For instance, in James Mitchell's<a name="NtA_558"
  href="#Nt_558"><sup>[558]</sup></a> <i>Dictionary of the Mathematical and
  Physical Sciences</i>, 1823, 12mo, which, though he was not technically a
  publisher, was printed for him&mdash;a book I should recommend to the
  collector of works of reference&mdash;there is a temperate description of
  his doctrines, which one may almost swear was one of his conditions
  previous to undertaking the work. Phillips himself was not only an
  anti-Newtonian, but carried to a fearful excess the notion that statesmen
  and Newtonians were in league to deceive the world. He saw this plot in
  Mrs. Airy's<a name="NtA_559" href="#Nt_559"><sup>[559]</sup></a> pension,
  and in Mrs. Somerville's<a name="NtA_560"
  href="#Nt_560"><sup>[560]</sup></a>. In 1836, he <!-- Page 243 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page243"></a>[243]</span>did me the honor to
  attempt my conversion. In his first letter he says:</p>

  <p>"Sir Richard Phillips has an inveterate abhorrence of all the
  pretended wisdom of philosophy derived from the monks and doctors of the
  middle ages, and not less of those of higher name who merely sought to
  make the monkish philosophy more plausible, or so to disguise it as to
  mystify the mob of small thinkers."</p>

  <p>So little did his writings show any knowledge of antiquity, that I
  strongly suspect, if required to name one of the monkish doctors, he
  would have answered&mdash;Aristotle. These schoolmen, and the
  "philosophical trinity of gravitating force, projectile force, and void
  space," were the bogies of his life.</p>

  <p>I think he began to publish speculations in the <i>Monthly
  Magazine</i> (of which he was editor) in July 1817: these he republished
  separately in 1818. In the Preface, perhaps judging the feelings of
  others by his own, he says that he "fully expects to be vilified,
  reviled, and anathematized, for many years to come." Poor man! he was let
  alone. He appeals with confidence to the "impartial decision of
  posterity"; but posterity does not appoint a hearing for one per cent. of
  the appeals which are made; and it is much to be feared that an article
  in such a work of reference as this will furnish nearly all her materials
  fifty years hence. The following, addressed to M. Arago,<a name="NtA_561"
  href="#Nt_561"><sup>[561]</sup></a> in 1835, will give posterity as good
  a notion as she will probably need:</p>

  <p>"Even the present year has afforded <span
  class="scac">EVER-MEMORABLE</span> examples, paralleled only by that of
  the Romish Conclave which persecuted Galileo. Policy has adopted that
  maxim of Machiavel which teaches that it is <i>more prudent</i> to
  <i>reward</i> <!-- Page 244 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page244"></a>[244]</span>partisans than to <i>persecute</i>
  opponents. Hence, a bigotted party had influence enough with the late
  short-lived administration [I think he is wrong as to the administration]
  of Wellington, Peel, &amp;c., to confer munificent royal pensions on
  three writers whose sole distinction was their advocacy of the Newtonian
  philosophy. A Cambridge professor last year published an elaborate volume
  in illustration of <i>Gravitation</i>, and on him has been conferred a
  pension of 300<i>l.</i> per annum. A lady has written a light popular
  view of the Newtonian Dogmas, and she has been complimented by a pension
  of 200<i>l.</i> per annum. And another writer, who has recently published
  a volume to prove that the only true philosophy is that of Moses, has
  been endowed with a pension of 200<i>l.</i> per annum. Neither of them
  were needy persons, and the political and ecclesiastical bearing of the
  whole was indicated by another pension of 300<i>l.</i> bestowed on a
  political writer, the advocate of all abuses and prejudices. Whether the
  conduct of the Romish Conclave was more base for visiting with legal
  penalties the promulgation of the doctrines that the Earth turns on its
  axis and revolves around the Sun; or that of the British Court, for its
  craft in conferring pensions on the opponents of the plain corollary,
  that all the motions of the Earth are 'part and parcel' of these great
  motions, and those again and all like them consecutive displays of still
  greater motions in equality of action and reaction, is <span
  class="scac">A QUESTION</span> which must be reserved for the casuists of
  other generations.... I cannot expect that on a sudden you and your
  friends will come to my conclusion, that the present philosophy of the
  Schools and Universities of Europe, based on faith in witchcraft, magic,
  &amp;c., is a system of execrable nonsense, <i>by which quacks live on
  the faith of fools</i>; but I desire a free and fair examination of my
  Aphorisms, and if a few are admitted to be true, merely as courteous
  concessions to arithmetic, my purpose will be effected, for men will thus
  be led to think; and if they think, then the fabric <!-- Page 245
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page245"></a>[245]</span>of false
  assumptions, and degrading superstitions will soon tumble in ruins."</p>

  <p>This for posterity. For the present time I ground the fame of Sir R.
  Phillips on his having squared the circle without knowing it, or
  intending to do it. In the <i>Protest</i> presently noted he discovered
  that "the force taken as 1 is equal to the sum of all its fractions ...
  thus 1 = 1/4 + 1/9 + 1/16 + 1/25, &amp;c., carried to infinity." This the
  mathematician instantly sees is equivalent to the theorem that the
  circumference of any circle is double of the diagonal of the cube on its
  diameter.<a name="NtA_562" href="#Nt_562"><sup>[562]</sup></a></p>

  <p>I have examined the following works of Sir R. Phillips, and heard of
  many others:</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Sir Richard Phillips had four valuable qualities; honesty, zeal,
  ability, and courage. He applied them all to teaching <!-- Page 246
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page246"></a>[246]</span>matters about
  which he knew nothing; and gained himself an uncomfortable life and a

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>Historic doubts relative to Napoleon Buonaparte. London, 1819,
  8vo.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>This tract has since been acknowledged by Archbishop Whately<a
  name="NtA_566" href="#Nt_566"><sup>[566]</sup></a> and reprinted. It is
  certainly a paradox: but differs from most of those in my list as being a
  joke, and a satire upon the reasoning of those who cannot receive
  narrative, no matter what the evidence, which is to them utterly
  improbable <i>a priori</i>. But had it been serious earnest, it would not
  have been so absurd as many of those which I have brought forward. The
  next on the list is not a joke.</p>

  <p>The idea of the satire is not new. Dr. King,<a name="NtA_567"
  href="#Nt_567"><sup>[567]</sup></a> in the dispute on the genuineness of
  Phalaris, proved with humor that Bentley did not write his own
  dissertation. An attempt has lately been made, for the honor of Moses, to
  prove, <!-- Page 247 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page247"></a>[247]</span>without humor, that Bishop Colenso did not
  write his own book. This is intolerable: anybody who tries to use such a
  weapon without banter, plenty and good, and of form suited to the
  subject, should get the drubbing which the poor man got in the Oriental
  tale for striking the dervishes with the wrong hand.</p>

  <p>The excellent and distinguished author of this tract has ceased to
  live. I call him the Paley of our day: with more learning and more
  purpose than his predecessor; but perhaps they might have changed places
  if they had changed centuries. The clever satire above named is not the
  only work which he published without his name. The following was
  attributed to him, I believe rightly: "Considerations on the Law of
  Libel, as relating to Publications on the subject of Religion, by John
  Search." London, 1833, 8vo. This tract excited little attention: for
  those who should have answered, could not. Moreover, it wanted a
  prosecution to call attention to it: the fear of calling such attention
  may have prevented prosecutions. Those who have read it will have seen
  why.</p>

  <p>The theological review elsewhere mentioned attributes the pamphlet of
  John Search on blasphemous libel to Lord Brougham. This is quite absurd:
  the writer states points of law on credence where the judge must have
  spoken with authority. Besides which, a hundred points of style are
  decisive between the two. I think any one who knows Whately's writing
  will soon arrive at my conclusion. Lord Brougham himself informs me that
  he has no knowledge whatever of the pamphlet.</p>

  <p>It is stated in <i>Notes and Queries</i> (3 S. xi. 511) that Search
  was answered by the Bishop of Ferns<a name="NtA_568"
  href="#Nt_568"><sup>[568]</sup></a> as S.&nbsp;N., with <!-- Page 248 --><span

  <p>Voltaire Chrétien; preuves tirées de ses ouvrages. Paris, 1820,
  12mo.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>If Voltaire have not succeeded in proving himself a strong theist and
  a strong anti-revelationist, who is to succeed in proving himself one
  thing or the other in any matter whatsoever? By occasional confusion
  between theism and Christianity; by taking advantage of the formal
  phrases of adhesion to the Roman Church, which very often occur, and are
  often the happiest bits of irony in an ironical production; by citations
  of his morality, which is decidedly Christian, though often attributed to
  Brahmins; and so on&mdash;the author makes a fair case for his paradox,
  in the eyes of those who know no more than he tells them. If he had said
  that Voltaire was a better Christian than himself knew of, towards all
  mankind except men of letters, I for one should have agreed with him.</p>

  <p><i>Christian!</i> the word has degenerated into a synonym of
  <i>man</i>, in what are called Christian countries. So we have the parrot
  who "swore for all the world like a Christian," and the two dogs who
  "hated each other just like Christians." When the Irish duellist of the
  last century, whose name may be spared in consideration of its historic
  fame <!-- Page 249 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page249"></a>[249]</span>and the worthy people who bear it, was
  (June 12, 1786) about to take the consequence of his last brutal murder,
  the rope broke, and the criminal got up, and exclaimed, "By
  &mdash;&mdash; Mr. Sheriff, you ought to be ashamed of yourself! this
  rope is not strong enough to hang a dog, far less a Christian!" But such
  things as this are far from the worst depravations. As to a word so
  defiled by usage, it is well to know that there is a way of escape from
  it, without renouncing the New Testament. I suppose any one may assume
  for himself what I have sometimes heard contended for, that no New
  Testament word is to be used in religion in any sense except that of the
  New Testament. This granted, the question is settled. The word
  <i>Christian</i>, which occurs three times, is never recognized as
  anything but a term of contempt from those without the pale to those
  within. Thus, Herod Agrippa, who was deep in Jewish literature, and a
  correspondent of Josephus, says to Paul (Acts xxvi. 28), "Almost thou
  persuadest me to be (what I and other followers of the state religion
  despise under the name) a Christian." Again (Acts xi. 26), "The disciples
  (as they called <i>themselves</i>) were called (by the surrounding
  heathens) Christians first in Antioch." Thirdly (1 Peter iv. 16), "Let
  none of you suffer as a <i>murderer</i>.... But if as a <i>Christian</i>
  (as the heathen call it by whom the suffering comes), let him not be
  ashamed." That is to say, no <i>disciple</i> ever called <i>himself</i> a
  Christian, or applied the name, as from himself, to another disciple,
  from one end of the New Testament to the other; and no disciple need
  apply that name to himself in our day, if he dislike the associations
  with which the conduct of Christians has clothed it.</p>

  me when at Cambridge; the refutation (1819) of this asserted solution,
  presented to the Academy of Lisbon by Evangelista Torriano. I cannot say
  I read it. The tract above is an attack on modern mathematicians in

<p class="cenhead">DR. MILNER'S PARADOXES.</p>

  <p>1820. In this year died Dr. Isaac Milner,<a name="NtA_575"
  href="#Nt_575"><sup>[575]</sup></a> President of Queens' College,
  Cambridge, one of the class of rational paradoxers. Under this name I
  include all who, in private life, and in matters which concern
  themselves, take their own course, and suit their own notions, no matter
  what other people may think of them. These men will put things to uses
  they were never intended for, to the great distress and disgust of their
  gregarious friends. I am one of the class, and I could write a little
  book of cases in which I have incurred absolute reproach for not "doing
  as other people do." I will name two of my atrocities: I took one of
  those butter-dishes which have for a top a dome with holes in it, which
  is turned inward, out of reach of accident, when not in use. Turning the
  dome inwards, I filled the dish with water, and put a sponge in the dome:
  the holes let it fill with water, and I had a penwiper, always moist, and
  worth its price five times over. "Why! what do you mean? It was made to
  hold butter. You are always at some queer thing or other!" I bought a
  leaden comb, intended to dye the hair, it being supposed that the
  application of lead will have this effect. I did not try: but I divided
  the comb into two, separated the part of closed prongs from the other;
  and thus I had two ruling machines. The lead marks paper, and by drawing
  the end of one of the machines along a ruler, I could rule twenty lines
  at a time, quite fit to write on. I thought I should have killed a friend
  to whom I explained it: he could not for the life of him understand how
  leaden <i>lines</i> on paper would dye the hair.</p>

  <p>But Dr. Milner went beyond me. He wanted a seat suited to his shape,
  and he defied opinion to a fearful point. <!-- Page 252 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page252"></a>[252]</span>He spread a thick block
  of putty over a wooden chair and sat in it until it had taken a ceroplast
  copy of the proper seat. This he gave to a carpenter to be imitated in
  wood. One of the few now living who knew him&mdash;my friend, General
  Perronet Thompson<a name="NtA_576"
  href="#Nt_576"><sup>[576]</sup></a>&mdash;answers for the wood, which was
  shown him by Milner himself; but he does not vouch for the material being
  putty, which was in the story told me at Cambridge; William Frend<a
  name="NtA_577" href="#Nt_577"><sup>[577]</sup></a> also remembered it.
  Perhaps the Doctor took off his great seal in green wax, like the Crown;
  but some soft material he certainly adopted; and very comfortable he
  found the wooden copy.</p>

  <div class="figleft" style="width:10%;">
      <a href="images/adem_260.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/adem_260.png"
      alt="Milner's lamp" title="Milner's lamp" /></a>
  </div>
  <p>The same gentleman vouches for Milner's lamp: but this had visible
  <i>science</i> in it; the vulgar see no science in the construction of
  the chair. A hollow semi-cylinder, but not with a circular curve,
  revolved on pivots. The curve was calculated on the law that, whatever
  quantity of oil might be in the lamp, the position of equilibrium just
  brought the oil up to the edge of the cylinder, at which a bit of wick
  was placed. As the wick exhausted the oil, the cylinder slowly revolved
  about the pivots so as to keep the oil always touching the wick.</p>

  <p>Great discoveries are always laughed at; but it is very often not the
  laugh of incredulity; it is a mode of distorting the sense of inferiority
  into a sense of superiority, or a mimicry of superiority interposed
  between the laugher and his feeling of inferiority. Two persons in
  conversation <!-- Page 253 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page253"></a>[253]</span>agreed that it was often a nuisance not to
  be able to lay hands on a bit of paper to mark the place in a book, every
  bit of paper on the table was sure to contain something not to be spared.
  I very quietly said that I always had a stock of bookmarkers ready cut,
  with a proper place for them: my readers owe many of my anecdotes to this
  absurd practice. My two colloquials burst into a fit of laughter; about
  what? Incredulity was out of the question; and there could be nothing
  foolish in my taking measures to avoid what they knew was an
  inconvenience. I was in this matter obviously their superior, and so they
  laughed at me. Much more candid was the Royal Duke of the last century,
  who was noted for slow ideas. "The rain comes into my mouth," said he,
  while riding. "Had not your Royal Highness better shut your mouth?" said
  the equerry. The Prince did so, and ought, by rule, to have laughed
  heartily at his adviser; instead of this, he said quietly, "It doesn't
  come in now."</p>

  <p>This celebrated philosopher maintained that mathematics ought to be
  applied to psychology, in a separate tract, published also in 1822: the
  one above seems, therefore, to be his challenge on the subject. It is on
  <i>attention</i>, and I think it will hardly support Herbart's thesis. As
  a specimen of his formula, let <i>t</i> be the time elapsed since the
  consideration began, <span class="grk">&beta;</span> the whole perceptive
  intensity of the individual, <span class="grk">&phi;</span> the whole of
  his mental force, and <i>z</i> the force given to a notion by attention
  during the time <i>t</i>. Then,</p>

<p class="cenhead"><i>z</i> = <span class="grk">&phi;</span> (1 - <span class="grk">&epsilon;</span><sup>-<span class="grk">&beta;</span><i>t</i></sup>)</p>

  <p>Now for a test. There is a <i>jactura</i>, <i>v</i>, the meaning of
  which I do not comprehend. If there be anything in it, my mathematical
  readers ought to interpret it from the formula</p>

<p class="cenhead"><i>v</i> = <span class="grk">&pi;</span><span class="grk">&phi;</span><span class="grk">&beta;</span>/(1 - <span class="grk">&beta;</span>)<span class="grk">&epsilon;</span><sup>-<span class="grk">&beta;</span><i>t</i></sup> + C<span class="grk">&epsilon;</span><sup>-t</sup></p>

  <p>and to this task I leave them, wishing them better luck than mine. The
  time may come when other manifestations of mind, besides <i>belief</i>,
  shall be submitted to calculation: at that time, should it arrive, a
  final decision may be passed upon Herbart.</p>

  Behmen first announced the three working properties of nature, which

  harsh astringent, attractive compression; the bitter compunction,
  repulsive expansion; and the stinging anguish, duplex motion. The author
  hints that he has written other works, to which he gives no clue. I have
  heard that Behmen was pillaged by Newton, and Swedenborg<a name="NtA_583"

  actual quotations given by one correspondent only (1st S. viii. 565),
  that journal would have handed him down as a man of some real learning.
  An extraordinary man he certainly was: it is not one illiterate shoemaker

  Greek words, without showing <!-- Page 257 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  strong light: one for history of science, one for astronomy, and one for
  philology:</p>

  <p>"Sir Isaac Newton was of opinion that 'the atmosphere of the earth was
  the sensory of God; by which he was enabled to see quite round the

  through the earth.</p>

  is because the earth presents its watery hemisphere to the sun at one
  time and that of solid land the other; but why has he made his Oxonian
  astonished at the coincidence? It is what I taught in my attic twelve
  years before.</p>

  <p>"Again, admitting that the Eloim were powerful and intelligent beings
  that managed these things, we would accuse <i>them</i> of being the
  authors of all the sufferings of Chrisna. And as they and the
  constellation of Leo were below the horizon, and consequently cut off
  from the end of the zodiac, there were but eleven constellations of the
  zodiac to be seen; the three at the end were wanted, but those three
  would be accused of bringing Chrisna into the troubles which at last
  ended in his death. All this would be expressed in the Eastern language
  by saying that Chrisna was persecuted by those Judoth Ishcarioth!!!!!
  [the five notes of exclamation are the author's]. But the astronomy of
  those distant ages, when the sun was at the south pole in winter, would
  leave five of those Decans cut off from our view, in the latitude of

  <p>I might show at length how Michael is the sun, and the D'-ev-'l in
  French Di-ob-al, also 'L-evi-ath-an&mdash;the evi being the radical part
  both of d<i>evi</i>l and l<i>evi</i>athan&mdash;is the Nile, which the
  sun dried up for Moses to pass: a battle celebrated by Jude. Also how
  <i>Moses</i>, the same name as <i>Muses</i>, is from <i>mesha</i>, drawn
  out of the water, "and hence we called our land which is saved from the
  water by the name of <i>marsh</i>." But it will be of more use to collect
  the character of S.&nbsp;A.&nbsp;M. from such correspondents of <i>Notes and

  astronomical and philological attainments, much ability and learning; had
  evidently read and studied deeply; remarkable for the originality of his
  views upon the very abstruse subject of mythological astronomy, in which
  he exhibited great sagacity. Certainly his views were <i>original</i>;

<p class="cenhead">A KANTESIAN JEWELER.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>Principles of the Kantesian, or transcendental philosophy. By Thomas
  Wirgman.<a name="NtA_590" href="#Nt_590"><sup>[590]</sup></a> London,
  1824, 8vo.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Mr. Wirgman's mind was somewhat attuned to psychology; but he was
  cracky and vagarious. He had been a fashionable jeweler in St. James's
  Street, no doubt the son or grandson of Wirgman at "the well-known
  toy-shop in <!-- Page 259 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page259"></a>[259]</span>St. James's Street," where Sam Johnson
  smartened himself with silver buckles. (Boswell, <i>æt.</i> 69). He would
  not have the ridiculous large ones in fashion; and he would give no more
  than a guinea a pair; such, says Boswell, in Italics, were the
  <i>principles</i> of the business: and I think this may be the first
  place in which the philosophical word was brought down from heaven to mix
  with men. However this may be, <i>my</i> Wirgman sold snuff-boxes, among
  other things, and fifty years ago a fashionable snuff-boxer would be
  under inducement, if not positively obliged, to have a stock with very
  objectionable pictures. So it happened that Wirgman&mdash;by reason of a
  trifle too much candor&mdash;came under the notice of the
  <i>Suppression</i> Society, and ran considerable risk. Mr. Brougham was
  his counsel; and managed to get him acquitted. Years and years after
  this, when Mr. Brougham was deep in the formation of the London
  University (now University College), Mr. Wirgman called on him. "What
  now?" said Mr. B. with his most sarcastic look&mdash;a very perfect thing
  of its kind&mdash;"you're in a scrape again, I suppose!" "No! indeed!"
  said W., "my present object is to ask your interest for the chair of
  Moral Philosophy in the new University!" He had taken up Kant!</p>

  <p>Mr. Wirgman, an itinerant paradoxer, called on me in 1831: he came to
  convert me. "I assure you," said he, "I am nothing but an old brute of a
  jeweler;" and his eye and manner were of the extreme of jocosity, as good
  in their way, as the satire of his former counsel. I mention him as one
  of that class who go away quite satisfied that they have wrought
  conviction. "Now," said he, "I'll make it clear to you! Suppose a number
  of gold-fishes in a glass bowl,&mdash;you understand? Well! I come with
  my cigar and go puff, puff, puff, over the bowl, until there is a little
  cloud of smoke: now, tell me, what will the gold-fishes say to that?" "I
  should imagine," said I, "That they would not know what to make of it."
  "By Jove! you're a Kantian;" said he, and with this and the like, he left
  me, vowing that <!-- Page 260 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page260"></a>[260]</span>it was delightful to talk to so
  intelligent a person. The greatest compliment Wirgman ever received was
  from James Mill, who used to say he did not <i>understand</i> Kant. That
  such a man as Mill should think this worth saying is a feather in the cap
  of the jocose jeweler.</p>

  <p>Some of my readers will stare at my supposing that Boswell may have
  been the first down-bringer of the word <i>principles</i> into common
  life; the best answer will be a prior instance of the word as true
  vernacular; it has never happened to me to notice one. Many words have
  very common uses which are not old. Take the following from Nichols
  (<i>Anecd.</i> ix. 263): "Lord Thurlow presents his best respects to Mr.
  and Mrs. Thicknesse, and assures them that he knows of no cause to
  complain of any part of Mr. Thicknesse's carriage; least of all the
  circumstance of sending the head to Ormond Street." Surely Mr. T. had
  lent Lord T. a satisfactory carriage with a movable head, and the above
  is a polite answer to inquiries. Not a bit of it! <i>carriage</i> is here
  <i>conduct</i>, and the <i>head</i> is a <i>bust</i>. The vehicles of the
  rich, at the time, were coaches, chariots, chaises, etc., never
  carriages, which were rather <i>carts</i>. Gibbon has the word for
  baggage-wagons. In Jane Austen's novels the word carriage is
  established.</p>

<p class="cenhead">WALSH'S DELUSIONS.</p>

  <p><i>John Walsh</i>,<a name="NtA_591"
  href="#Nt_591"><sup>[591]</sup></a> of Cork (1786-1847). This discoverer
  has had the honor of a biography from Professor Boole, who, at my
  request, collected information about him on the scene of his labors. It
  is in the <i>Philosophical Magazine</i> for November, 1851, and will, I
  hope, be transferred to some biographical collection where it may find a
  larger class of readers. It is the best biography of a single hero of the
  kind that I know. Mr. Walsh introduced himself to me, <!-- Page 261
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page261"></a>[261]</span>as he did to
  many others, in the anterowlandian days of the Post-office; his unpaid
  letters were double, treble, &amp;c. They contained his pamphlets, and
  cost their weight in silver: all have the name of the author, and all are
  in octavo or in quarto letter-form: most are in four pages, and all dated
  from Cork. I have the following by me:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

</blockquote>

  <p>Besides these, there is a <i>Metalogia</i>, and I know not how many
  others.</p>

  <p>Mr. Boole,<a name="NtA_592" href="#Nt_592"><sup>[592]</sup></a> who
  has taken the moral and social features of Walsh's delusions from the
  commiserating point of view, which makes ridicule out of place, has been
  obliged to treat Walsh as Scott's Alan Fairford treated his client Peter
  Peebles; namely, keep the scarecrow out of court while the case was
  argued. My plan requires me to bring him in: and when he comes in at the
  door, pity and sympathy fly out at the window. Let the reader remember
  that he was not an ignoramus in mathematics: he might have won his spurs
  if he could have first served as an esquire. Though so illiterate that
  even in Ireland he never picked up anything more Latin than
  <i>Irelandus</i>, he was a very pretty mathematician spoiled in the
  making by intense self-opinion.</p>

  <p>This is part of a private letter to me at the back of a page of print:
  I had never addressed a word to him:</p>

<p><!-- Page 262 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page262"></a>[262]</span></p>

  <p>"There are no limits in mathematics, and those that assert there are,
  are infinite ruffians, ignorant, lying blackguards. There is no
  differential calculus, no Taylor's theorem, no calculus of variations,
  &amp;c. in mathematics. There is no quackery whatever in mathematics; no
  % equal to anything. What sheer ignorant blackguardism that!</p>

  <p>"In mechanics the parallelogram of forces is quackery, and is
  dangerous; for nothing is at rest, or in uniform, or in rectilinear
  motion, in the universe. Variable motion is an essential property of
  matter. Laplace's demonstration of the parallelogram of forces is a
  begging of the question; and the attempts of them all to show that the
  difference of twenty minutes between the sidereal and actual revolution
  of the earth round the sun arises from the tugging of the Sun and Moon at
  the pot-belly of the earth, without being sure even that the earth has a
  pot-belly at all, is perfect quackery. The said difference arising from
  and demonstrating the revolution of the Sun itself round some distant
  center."</p>

  <p>In the letter to Lord Brougham we read as follows:</p>

  <p>"I ask the Royal Society of London, I ask the Saxon crew of that crazy
  hulk, where is the dogma of their philosophic god now?... When the Royal
  Society of London, and the Academy of Sciences of Paris, shall have read
  this memorandum, how will they appear? Like two cur dogs in the paws of
  the noblest beast of the forest.... Just as this note was going to press,
  a volume lately published by you was put into my hands, wherein you
  attempt to defend the fluxions and <i>Principia</i> of Newton. Man! what
  are you about? You come forward now with your special pleading, and
  fraught with national prejudice, to defend, like the philosopher
  Grassi,<a name="NtA_593" href="#Nt_593"><sup>[593]</sup></a> the
  persecutor of Galileo, principles <!-- Page 263 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page263"></a>[263]</span>and reasoning which,
  unless you are actually insane, or an ignorant quack in mathematics, you
  know are mathematically false. What a moral lesson this for the students
  of the University of London from its head! Man! demonstrate corollary 3,
  in this note, by the lying dogma of Newton, or turn your thoughts to
  something you understand.</p>

  <p class="author">"<span class="sc">Walsh Irelandus.</span>"

  <p>Mr. Walsh&mdash;honor to his memory&mdash;once had the consideration
  to save me postage by addressing a pamphlet under cover to a Member of
  Parliament, with an explanatory letter. In that letter he gives a candid
  opinion of himself:</p>

  <p>(1838.) "Mr. Walsh takes leave to send the enclosed corrected copy to
  Mr. Hutton as one of the Council of the University of London, and to save
  postage for the Professor of Mathematics there. He will find in it
  geometry more deep and subtle, and at the same time more simple and
  elegant, than it was ever contemplated human genius could invent."</p>

  <p>He then proceeds to set forth that a certain "tomfoolery lemma," with
  its "tomfoolery" superstructure, "never had existence outside the shallow
  brains of its inventor," Euclid. He then proceeds thus:</p>

  <p>"The same spirit that animated those philosophers who sent Galileo to
  the Inquisition animates all the philosophers of the present day without
  exception. If anything can free them from the yoke of error, it is the
  [Walsh] problem of double tangence. But free them it will, how deeply
  soever they may be sunk into mental slavery&mdash;and God knows that is
  deeply enough; and they bear it with an admirable grace; for none bear
  slavery with a better grace than tyrants. The lads must adopt my
  theory.... It will be a sad reverse for all our great professors to be
  compelled to become schoolboys in their gray years. But the sore scratch
  is to be compelled, as they had before been compelled one thousand years
  ago, to have recourse to Ireland for instruction." <!-- Page 264 --><span

  ought to warn all who rely on their own evidence to their own success. He
  was not, properly speaking, insane; he only spoke his mind more freely
  than many others of his class. The poor fellow died in the Cork union,
  during the famine. He had lived a happy life, contemplating his own

<p class="cenhead">GROWTH OF FREEDOM OF OPINION.</p>

  <p>The year 1825 brings me to about the middle of my <i>Athenæum</i>
  list: that is, so far as mere number of names mentioned is concerned.
  Freedom of opinion, beyond a doubt, is gaining ground, for good or for
  evil, according to what the speaker happens to think: admission of
  authority is no longer made in the old way. If we take soul-cure and
  body-cure, divinity and medicine, it is manifest that a change has come
  over us. Time was when it was enough that dose or dogma should be
  certified by "Il a été ordonné, Monsieur, il a été ordonné,"<a
  name="NtA_595" href="#Nt_595"><sup>[595]</sup></a> as the apothecary said
  when he wanted to operate upon poor de Porceaugnac. Very much changed:
  but whether for good or for evil does not now matter; the question is,
  whether contempt of <i>demonstration</i> such as our paradoxers show has
  augmented with the rejection of <i>dogmatic authority</i>. It ought to be
  just the other way: for the worship of reason is the system on which, if
  we trust them, the deniers of guidance ground their plan of life. The
  following attempt at an experiment on this point is the best which I can
  make; and, so far as I know, the first that ever was made.</p>

  <p>Say that my list of paradoxers divides in 1825: this of itself proves
  nothing, because so many of the earlier books are lost, or not likely to
  be come at. It would be a fearful rate of increase which would make the
  number of paradoxes since 1825 equal to the whole number before that
  date. Let us turn now to another collection of mine, arithmetical books,
  of which I have published a list. The two collections are similarly
  circumstanced as to new and old books; the paradoxes had no care given to
  the collection of either; the arithmetical books equal care to both. The
  list of arithmetical books, published in 1847, divides at 1735; the
  paradoxes, up to 1863, divide at 1825. If we take the process which is
  most against the distinction, and allow every year <!-- Page 266 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page266"></a>[266]</span>from 1847 to 1863 to
  add a year to 1735, we should say that the arithmetical writers divide at
  1751. This rough process may serve, with sufficient certainty, to show
  that the proportion of paradoxes to books of sober demonstration is on
  the increase; and probably, quite as much as the proportion of
  heterodoxes to books of orthodox adherence. So that divinity and medicine
  may say to geometry, Don't <i>you</i> sneer: if rationalism,
  hom&oelig;opathy, and their congeners are on the rise among us, your
  enemies are increasing quite as fast. But geometry replies&mdash;Dear
  friends, content yourselves with the rational inference that the rise of
  heterodoxy within your pales is not conclusive against you, taken alone;
  for it rises at the same time within mine. Store within your garners the
  precious argument that you are not proved wrong by increase of dissent;
  because there is increase of dissent against exact science. But do not
  therefore <i>even</i> yourselves to me: remember that you, Dame Divinity,
  have inflicted every kind of penalty, from the stake to the stocks, in
  aid of your reasoning; remember that you, Mother Medicine, have not many
  years ago applied to Parliament for increase of forcible hindrance of
  antipharmacop&oelig;al drenches, pills, and powders. Who ever heard of my
  asking the legislature to fine blundering circle-squarers? Remember that
  the D in dogma is the D in decay; but the D in demonstration is the D in
  durability.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="cenhead">THE STATUS OF MEDICINE.</p>

  <p>I have known a medical man&mdash;a young one&mdash;who was seriously
  of the opinion that the country ought to be divided into medical
  parishes, with a practitioner appointed to each, and a penalty for
  calling in any but the incumbent curer. How should people know how to
  choose? The hair-dressers once petitioned Parliament for an act to compel
  people to wear wigs. My own opinion is of the opposite extreme, as in the
  following letter (<i>Examiner</i>, April 5, 1856); which, to my surprise,
  I saw reprinted in a medical journal, as a <!-- Page 267 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page267"></a>[267]</span>plan not absolutely to
  be rejected. I am perfectly satisfied that it would greatly promote true
  medical orthodoxy, the predominance of well educated thinkers, and the
  development of their desirable differences.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>"<span class="sc">Sir.</span> The Medical Bill and the medical
  question generally is one on which experience would teach, if people
  would be taught.</p>

  <p>"The great soul question took three hundred years to settle: the
  little body question might be settled in thirty years, if the decisions
  in the former question were studied.</p>

  <p>"Time was when the State believed, as honestly as ever it believed
  anything, that it <i>might</i>, <i>could</i>, and <i>should</i> find out
  the true doctrine for the poor ignorant community; to which, like a
  worthy honest state, it added <i>would</i>. Accordingly, by the
  assistance of the Church, which undertook the physic, the surgery, and
  the pharmacy of sound doctrine all by itself, it sent forth its legally
  qualified teachers into every parish, and woe to the man who called in
  any other. They burnt that man, they whipped him, they imprisoned him,
  they did everything but what was Christian to him, all for his soul's
  health and the amendment of his excesses.</p>

  <p>"But men would not submit. To the argument that the State was a father
  to the ignorant, they replied that it was at best the ignorant father of
  an ignorant son, and that a blind man could find his way into a ditch
  without another blind man to help him. And when the State said&mdash;But
  here we have the Church, which knows all about it, the ignorant community
  declared that it had a right to judge that question, and that it would
  judge it. It also said that the Church was never one thing long, and that
  it progressed, on the whole, rather more slowly than the ignorant
  community.</p>

  <p>"The end of it was, in this country, that every one who chose taught
  all who chose to let him teach, on condition only of an open and true
  registration. The State was <!-- Page 268 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page268"></a>[268]</span>allowed to patronize one particular
  Church, so that no one need trouble himself to choose a pastor from the
  mere necessity of choosing. But every church is allowed its colleges, its
  studies, its diplomas; and every man is allowed his choice. There is no
  proof that our souls are worse off than in the sixteenth century; and,
  judging by fruits, there is much reason to hope they are better off.</p>

  <p>"Now the little body question is a perfect parallel to the great soul
  question in all its circumstances. The only things in which the parallel
  fails are the following: Every one who believes in a future state sees
  that the soul question is incomparably more important than the body
  question, and every one can try the body question by experiment to a
  larger extent than the soul question. The proverb, which always has a
  spark of truth at the bottom, says that every man of forty is either a
  fool or a physician; but did even the proverb maker ever dare to say that
  every man is at any age either a fool or a fit teacher of religion?</p>

  <p>"Common sense points out the following settlement of the medical
  question: and to this it will come sooner or later.</p>

  <p>"Let every man who chooses&mdash;subject to one common law of
  manslaughter for all the <i>crass</i> cases&mdash;doctor the bodies of
  all who choose to trust him, and recover payment according to agreement
  in the courts of law. Provided always that every person practising should
  be registered at a moderate fee in a register to be republished every six
  months.</p>

  <p>"Let the register give the name, address, and asserted qualification
  of each candidate&mdash;as licentiate, or doctor, or what not, of this or
  that college, hall, university, &amp;c., home or foreign. Let it be
  competent to any man to describe himself as qualified by study in public
  schools without a diploma, or by private study, or even by intuition or
  divine inspiration, if he please. But whatever he holds his qualification
  to be, that let him declare. Let all qualification <!-- Page 269 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page269"></a>[269]</span>which of its own nature
  admits of proof be proved, as by the diploma or certificate, &amp;c.,
  leaving things which cannot be proved, as asserted private study,
  intuition, inspiration, &amp;c., to work their own way.</p>

  <p>"Let it be highly penal to assert to the patient any qualification
  which is not in the register, and let the register be sold very cheap.
  Let the registrar give each registered practitioner a copy of the
  register in his own case; let any patient have the power to demand a
  sight of this copy; and let no money for attendance be recoverable in any
  case in which there has been false representation.</p>

  <p>"Let any party in any suit have a right to produce what medical
  testimony he pleases. Let the medical witness produce his register, and
  let his evidence be for the jury, as is that of an engineer or a
  practitioner of any art which is not attested by diplomas.</p>

  <p>"Let any man who practises without venturing to put his name on the
  register be liable to fine and imprisonment.</p>

  <p>"The consequence would be that, as now, anybody who pleases might
  practise; for the medical world is well aware that there is no power of
  preventing what they call quacks from practising. But very different from
  what is now, every man who practises would be obliged to tell the whole
  world what his claim is, and would run a great risk if he dared to tell
  his patient in private anything different from what he had told the whole
  world.</p>

  <p>"The consequence would be that a real education in anatomy,
  physiology, chemistry, surgery, and what is known of the thing called
  medicine, would acquire more importance than it now has.</p>

  <p>"It is curious to see how completely the medical man of the nineteenth
  century squares with the priest of the sixteenth century. The clergy of
  all sects are now better divines and better men than they ever were. They
  have lost Bacon's reproach that they took a smaller measure of things
  than any other educated men; and the physicians are now <!-- Page 270
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page270"></a>[270]</span>in this
  particular the rearguard of the learned world; though it may be true that
  the rear in our day is further on in the march than the van of Bacon's
  day. Nor will they ever recover the lost position until medicine is as
  free as religion.</p>

  <p>"To this it must come. To this the public, which will decide for
  itself, has determined it shall come. To this the public has, in fact,
  brought it, but on a plan which it is not desirable to make permanent. We
  will be as free to take care of our bodies as of our souls and of our
  goods. This is the profession of all who sign as I do, and the practice
  of most of those who would not like the name</p>

  <p>I remember a votary of the Society being asked to substitute for
  <i>reason</i> "the right leg," and for <i>guide</i> "support," and to
  answer the two last questions: he said there must be a quibble, but he
  did not see what. It is pleasant to reflect that the <i>argumentum à

  obsolete. One great defect of it was that it did not go far enough: there

  dealing at their shops, and against rich widows marrying them.</p>

  <p>Had I taken in theology, I must have entered books against
  Christianity. I mention the above, and Paine's <i>Age of Reason</i>,
  simply because they are the only English modern works that ever came in

  had been so complimented by church and state. And when I had read it, I

  <p>I long thought that no human being could say this under any

  writer&mdash;as he thought himself&mdash;who threw aspersions on his
  opponents thick and threefold. Heyday! came into my head, this fellow
  flings muck beds; he must be a quartz pyx. And then I remembered that a
  pyx is a sacred vessel, and quartz is a hard stone, as hard as the heart
  of a religious foe-curser. So that the line is the motto of the ferocious
  sectarian, who turns his religious vessels into mudholders, for the

  <p>Which in more sober English would be, Marry; be cheerful; watch your

  <p>The first work had an additional preface and a new index in 1829.
  Possibly, in future time, will be found bound up with copies of the
  second work two sheets which Mr. Higgins circulated among his friends in
  1831: the first a "Recapitulation," the second "Book vi. ch. 1."</p>

  <p>The system of these works is that&mdash;</p>

  <p>"The Buddhists of Upper India (of whom the Phenician Canaanite,
  Melchizedek, was a priest), who built the Pyramids, Stonehenge, Carnac,
  &amp;c. will be shown to have founded all the ancient mythologies of the
  world, which, however varied and corrupted in recent times, were
  originally one, and that one founded on principles sublime, beautiful,
  and true."</p>

<p><!-- Page 275 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page275"></a>[275]</span></p>

  <p>These works contain an immense quantity of learning, very honestly put
  together. I presume the enormous number of facts, and the goodness of the
  index, to be the reasons why the <i>Anacalypsis</i> found a permanent
  place in the <i>old</i> reading-room of the British Museum, even before
  the change which greatly increased the number of books left free to the
  reader in that room.</p>

  <p>Mr. Higgins, whom I knew well in the last six years of his life, and
  respected as a good, learned, and (in his own way) <i>pious</i> man, was
  thoroughly and completely the man of a system. He had that sort of mental
  connection with his theory that made his statements of his authorities
  trustworthy: for, besides perfect integrity, he had no bias towards
  alteration of facts: he saw his system in the way the fact was presented
  to him by his authority, be that what it might.</p>

  <p>He was very sure of a fact which he got from any of his authorities:
  nothing could shake him. Imagine a conversation between him and an Indian
  officer who had paid long attention to Hindoo antiquities and their
  remains: a third person was present, <i>ego qui scribo</i>. <i>G. H.</i>
  "You know that in the temples of I-forget-who the Ceres is always
  sculptured precisely as in Greece." <i>Col.</i> &mdash;&mdash;, "I really
  do not remember it, and I have seen most of these temples." <i>G. H.</i>
  "It is so, I assure you, especially at I-forget-where." <i>Col.</i>
  &mdash;&mdash;, "Well, I am sure! I was encamped for six weeks at the
  gate of that very temple, and, except a little shooting, had nothing to
  do but to examine its details, which I did, day after day, and I found
  nothing of the kind." It was of no use at all.</p>

  <p>Godfrey Higgins began life by exposing and conquering, at the expense
  of two years of his studies, some shocking abuses which existed in the
  York Lunatic Asylum. This was a proceeding which called much attention to
  the treatment of the insane, and produced much good effect. He was very
  resolute and energetic. The magistracy of his <!-- Page 276 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page276"></a>[276]</span>time had such scruples
  about using the severity of law to people of such station as well-to-do
  farmers, &amp;c.: they would allow a great deal of resistance, and
  endeavor to mollify the rebels into obedience. A young farmer flatly
  refused to pay under an order of affiliation made upon him by Godfrey
  Higgins. He was duly warned; and persisted: he shortly found himself in
  gaol. He went there sure to conquer the Justice, and the first thing he
  did was to demand to see his lawyer. He was told, to his horror, that as
  soon as he had been cropped and prison-dressed, he might see as many
  lawyers as he pleased, to be looked at, laughed at, and advised that
  there was but one way out of the scrape. Higgins was, in his
  speculations, a regular counterpart of Bailly; but the celebrated Mayor
  of Paris had not his nerve. It was impossible to say, if their characters
  had been changed, whether the unfortunate crisis in which Bailly was not
  equal to the occasion would have led to very different results if Higgins
  had been in his place: but assuredly constitutional liberty would have
  had one chance more. There are two works of his by which he was known,
  apart from his paradoxes. First, <i>An apology for the life and character
  of the celebrated prophet of Arabia, called Mohamed, or the
  Illustrious</i>. London, 8vo. 1829. The reader will look at this writing
  of our English Buddhist with suspicious eye, but he will not be able to
  avoid confessing that the Arabian prophet has some reparation to demand
  at the hands of Christians. Next, <i>Horæ Sabaticæ; or an attempt to
  correct certain superstitions and vulgar errors respecting the
  Sabbath</i>. Second edition, with a large appendix. London, 12mo. 1833.
  This book was very heterodox at the time, but it has furnished material
  for some of the clergy of our day.</p>

  <p>I never could quite make out whether Godfrey Higgins took that system
  which he traced to the Buddhists to have a Divine origin, or to be the
  result of good men's meditations. Himself a strong theist, and believer
  in a future <!-- Page 277 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page277"></a>[277]</span>state, one would suppose that he would
  refer a <i>universal</i> religion, spread in different forms over the
  whole earth from one source, directly to the universal Parent. And this I
  suspect he did, whether he knew it or not. The external evidence is
  balanced. In his preface he says:</p>

  <p>"I cannot help smiling when I consider that the priests have objected
  to admit my former book, <i>The Celtic Druids</i>, into libraries,
  because it was antichristian; and it has been attacked by Deists, because
  it was superfluously religious. The learned Deist, the Rev. R. Taylor
  [already mentioned], has designated me as the <i>religious</i> Mr.
  Higgins."</p>

  <p>The time will come when some profound historian of literature will
  make himself much clearer on the point than I am.</p>

<p class="cenhead">A DISCOURSE ON PROBABILITY.</p>

  <p>About 1830 was published, in the <i>Library of Useful Knowledge</i>,
  the tract on <i>Probability</i>, the joint work of the late Sir John
  Lubbock<a name="NtA_611" href="#Nt_611"><sup>[611]</sup></a> and Mr.
  Drinkwater (Bethune).<a name="NtA_612"
  href="#Nt_612"><sup>[612]</sup></a> It is one of the best elementary
  openings of the subject. A binder put my name on the outside (the work
  was anonymous) and the consequence was that nothing could drive out of
  people's heads that it was written by me. I do not know how many denials
  I have made, from a passage in one of my own works to a letter in the
  <i>Times</i>: and I am not sure that I have succeeded in establishing the
  truth, even now. I accordingly note the fact once more. But as a book has
  no right here unless it contain a paradox&mdash;or thing counter to
  general opinion or practice&mdash;I will produce two small ones. Sir John
  Lubbock, with whom lay the executive arrangement, had a strong objection
  to the last word in "Theory of Probabilities," he maintained that the

  could not bear <i>head</i> and <i>tail</i>, even in a work on games of

  first saw this: but, to my delight, I found that the force of
  circumstances beat him at last. He was obliged to take an example from
  the race-course, and the name of one of the horses was <i>Bessy

  <p>This book contains all the drawings of the French lottery (two or
  three, each month) from 1758 to 1830. It is intended for those who
  thought they could predict the future drawings from the past: and various
  sets of <i>sympathetic</i> numbers are given to help them. The principle
  is, that anything which has not happened for a long time must be soon to
  come. At <i>rouge et noir</i>, for example, when the red has won five
  times running, sagacious gamblers stake on the black, for they think the
  turn which must come at last is nearer than it was. So it is: but
  observation would have shown that if a large number of those cases had
  been registered which show a run of five for the red, the next game would
  just as often have made the run into six as have turned in favor of the
  black. But the gambling reasoner is incorrigible: if he would but take to
  squaring the circle, what a load of misery would be saved. A writer of
  1823, who appeared to be thoroughly acquainted with the gambling of Paris
  and London, says that the gamesters by <!-- Page 281 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page281"></a>[281]</span>profession are haunted
  by a secret foreboding of their future destruction, and seem as if they
  said to the banker at the table, as the gladiators said to the emperor,
  <i>Morituri te salutant</i>.<a name="NtA_613"
  href="#Nt_613"><sup>[613]</sup></a></p>

  <p>In the French lottery, five numbers out of ninety were drawn at a
  time. Any person, in any part of the country, might stake any sum upon
  any event he pleased, as that 27 should be drawn; that 42 and 81 should
  be drawn; that 42 and 81 should be drawn, and 42 first; and so on up to a
  <i>quine déterminé</i>, if he chose, which is betting on five given
  numbers in a given order. Thus, in July, 1821, one of the drawings
  was</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>8 &nbsp; 46 &nbsp; 16 &nbsp; 64 &nbsp; 13.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>A gambler had actually predicted the five numbers (but not their
  order), and won 131,350 francs on a trifling stake. M. Menut seems to
  insinuate that the hint what numbers to choose was given at his own
  office. Another won 20,852 francs on the quaterne, 8, 16, 46, 64, in this
  very drawing. These gains, of course, were widely advertised: of the
  multitudes who lost nothing was said. The enormous number of those who
  played is proved to all who have studied chances arithmetically by the
  numbers of simple quaternes which were gained: in 1822, fourteen; in
  1823, six; in 1824, sixteen; in 1825, nine, &amp;c.</p>

  <p>The paradoxes of what is called chance, or hazard, might themselves
  make a small volume. All the world understands that there is a long run,
  a general average; but great part of the world is surprised that this
  general average should be computed and predicted. There are many
  remarkable cases of verification; and one of them relates to the
  quadrature of the circle. I give some account of this and another. Throw
  a penny time after time until <i>head</i> arrives, which it will do
  before long: let this be called a <i>set</i>. Accordingly, H is the
  smallest set, TH the next smallest, then TTH, &amp;c. For abbreviation,
  let a set in which seven <i>tails</i> <!-- Page 282 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page282"></a>[282]</span>occur before
  <i>head</i> turns up be T<sup>7</sup>H. In an immense number of trials of
  sets, about half will be H; about a quarter TH; about an eighth,
  T<sup>2</sup>H. Buffon<a name="NtA_614"
  href="#Nt_614"><sup>[614]</sup></a> tried 2,048 sets; and several have
  followed him. It will tend to illustrate the principle if I give all the
  results; namely, that many trials will with moral certainty show an
  approach&mdash;and the greater the greater the number of trials&mdash;to
  that average which sober reasoning predicts. In the first column is the
  most likely number of the theory: the next column gives Buffon's result;
  the three next are results obtained from trial by correspondents of mine.
  In each case the number of trials is 2,048.</p>

  <p>In very many trials, then, we may depend upon something like the
  predicted average. Conversely, from many trials we may form a guess at
  what the average will be. Thus, in Buffon's experiment the 2,048 first
  throws of the sets gave <i>head</i> in 1,061 cases: we have a right to
  infer that in the long run something like 1,061 out of 2,048 is the
  proportion of heads, even before we know the reasons for the equality of
  chance, which tell us that 1,024 out of 2,048 is the real truth. I now
  come to the way in which such considerations have led to a mode in which
  mere pitch-and-toss has given a more accurate approach to the quadrature
  of the circle than has been reached by some of my paradoxers. What would
  my friend<a name="NtA_615" href="#Nt_615"><sup>[615]</sup></a> in No. 14
  have said to this? The method is as follows: Suppose a planked floor of
  the usual kind, with thin visible seams between the planks. Let there be
  a thin straight rod, or wire, not so long as the breadth of the plank.
  This rod, being tossed up at hazard, will either fall quite clear of the
  seams, or will lay across one seam. Now Buffon, and after him Laplace,
  proved the following: That in the long run the fraction of the whole
  number of trials in which a seam is intersected will be the fraction
  which twice the length of the rod is of the circumference of the circle
  having the breadth of a plank for its diameter. In 1855 Mr.
  <i>Ambrose</i> Smith, of Aberdeen, made 3,204 trials with a rod
  three-fifths of the distance between the planks: there were 1,213 clear
  intersections, and 11 contacts on which it was difficult to decide.
  Divide these contacts equally, and we have 1,218½ to 3,204 for the ratio
  of 6 to 5<span class="grk">&pi;</span>, presuming that the greatness of
  the number of trials gives something near to the final average, or result
  in the long run: this gives <span class="grk">&pi;</span> = 3.1553. If
  all the 11 contacts had been treated as intersections, the result would
  have been <!-- Page 284 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page284"></a>[284]</span><span class="grk">&pi;</span> = 3.1412,
  exceedingly near. A pupil of mine made 600 trials with a rod of the
  length between the seams, and got <span class="grk">&pi;</span> =
  3.137.</p>

  <p>This method will hardly be believed until it has been repeated so
  often that "there never could have been any doubt about it."</p>

  <p>The first experiment strongly illustrates a truth of the theory, well
  confirmed by practice: whatever can happen will happen if we make trials
  enough. Who would undertake to throw tail eight times running?
  Nevertheless, in the 8,192 sets tail 8 times running occurred 17 times; 9
  times running, 9 times; 10 times running, twice; 11 times and 13 times,
  each once; and 15 times twice.]</p>

<p class="cenhead">ON CURIOSITIES OF <span class="grk">&pi;</span>.</p>

  <p>1830. The celebrated interminable fraction 3.14159..., which the
  mathematician calls <span class="grk">&pi;</span>, is the ratio of the
  circumference to the diameter. But it is thousands of things besides. It
  is constantly turning up in mathematics: and if arithmetic and algebra
  had been studied without geometry, <span class="grk">&pi;</span> must
  have come in somehow, though at what stage or under what name must have
  depended upon the casualties of algebraical invention. This will readily
  be seen when it is stated that <span class="grk">&pi;</span> is nothing
  but four times the series</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>1 - 1/3 + 1/5 - 1/7 + 1/9 - 1/11 + ...</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p><i>ad infinitum</i>.<a name="NtA_616"
  href="#Nt_616"><sup>[616]</sup></a> It would be wonderful if so simple a
  series <!-- Page 285 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page285"></a>[285]</span>had but one kind of occurrence. As it is,
  our trigonometry being founded on the circle, <span
  class="grk">&pi;</span> first appears as the ratio stated. If, for
  instance, a deep study of probable fluctuation from average had preceded,
  <span class="grk">&pi;</span> might have emerged as a number perfectly
  indispensable in such problems as: What is the chance of the number of
  aces lying between a million + <i>x</i> and a million - <i>x</i>, when
  six million of throws are made with a die? I have not gone into any
  detail of all those cases in which the paradoxer finds out, by his
  unassisted acumen, that results of mathematical investigation <i>cannot
  be</i>: in fact, this discovery is only an accompaniment, though a
  necessary one, of his paradoxical statement of that which <i>must be</i>.
  Logicians are beginning to see that the notion of <i>horse</i> is
  inseparably connected with that of <i>non-horse</i>: that the first
  without the second would be no notion at all. And it is clear that the
  positive affirmation of that which contradicts mathematical demonstration
  cannot but be accompanied by a declaration, mostly overtly made, that
  demonstration is false. If the mathematician were interested in punishing
  this indiscretion, he could make his denier ridiculous by inventing
  asserted results which would completely take him in.</p>

  <p>More than thirty years ago I had a friend, now long gone, who was a
  mathematician, but not of the higher branches: he was, <i>inter alia</i>,
  thoroughly up in all that relates to mortality, life assurance, &amp;c.
  One day, explaining to him how it should be ascertained what the chance
  is of the survivors of a large number of persons now alive lying between
  given limits of number at the end of a certain time, I came, of course
  upon the introduction of <span class="grk">&pi;</span>, which I could
  only describe as the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its
  diameter. "Oh, my dear friend! that must be a delusion; what can the
  circle have to do with the numbers alive at the end of a given
  time?"&mdash;"I cannot demonstrate it to you; but it is
  demonstrated."&mdash;"Oh! stuff! I think you can prove anything with your
  differential calculus: figment, <!-- Page 286 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page286"></a>[286]</span>depend upon it." I said no more; but, a
  few days afterwards, I went to him and very gravely told him that I had
  discovered the law of human mortality in the Carlisle Table, of which he
  thought very highly. I told him that the law was involved in this
  circumstance. Take the table of expectation of life, choose any age, take
  its expectation and make the nearest integer a new age, do the same with
  that, and so on; begin at what age you like, you are sure to end at the
  place where the age past is equal, or most nearly equal, to the
  expectation to come. "You don't mean that this always
  happens?"&mdash;"Try it." He did try, again and again; and found it as I
  said. "This is, indeed, a curious thing; this <i>is</i> a discovery." I
  might have sent him about trumpeting the law of life: but I contented
  myself with informing him that the same thing would happen with any table
  whatsoever in which the first column goes up and the second goes down;
  and that if a proficient in the higher mathematics chose to palm a
  figment upon him, he could do without the circle: <i>à corsaire, corsaire
  et demi</i>,<a name="NtA_617" href="#Nt_617"><sup>[617]</sup></a> the
  French proverb says. "Oh!" it was remarked, "I see, this was Milne!"<a
  name="NtA_618" href="#Nt_618"><sup>[618]</sup></a> It was <i>not</i>
  Milne: I remember well showing the formula to him some time afterwards.
  He raised no difficulty about <span class="grk">&pi;</span>; he knew the
  forms of Laplace's results, and he was much interested. Besides, Milne
  never said stuff! and figment! And he would not have been taken in: he
  would have quietly tried it with the Northampton and all the other
  tables, and would have got at the truth.</p>

<p class="cenhead">THE LUNAR CAUSTIC JOKE.</p>

  <p>The following paragraph appeared in the <i>Morning Post</i>, May 4,
  1831:</p>

  <p>"We understand that although, owing to circumstances with which the
  public are not concerned, Mr. Goulburn<a name="NtA_623"
  href="#Nt_623"><sup>[623]</sup></a> declined becoming a candidate for
  University honors, that his scientific attainments are far from
  inconsiderable. He is well known to be the author of an essay in the
  Philosophical Transactions on the accurate rectification of a circular
  arc, and of an investigation of the equation of a lunar caustic&mdash;a
  problem likely to become of great use in nautical astronomy."</p>

<p><!-- Page 289 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page289"></a>[289]</span></p>

  <p>This hoax&mdash;which would probably have succeeded with any
  journal&mdash;was palmed upon the <i>Morning Post</i>, which supported
  Mr. Goulburn, by some Cambridge wags who supported Mr. Lubbock, the other
  candidate for the University of Cambridge. Putting on the usual
  concealment, I may say that I always suspected Dr-nkw-t-r B-th-n-<a
  name="NtA_624" href="#Nt_624"><sup>[624]</sup></a> of having a share in
  the matter. The skill of the hoax lies in avoiding the words "quadrature
  of the circle," which all know, and speaking of "the accurate
  rectification of a circular arc," which all do not know for its synonyme.
  The <i>Morning Post</i> next day gave a reproof to hoaxers in general,
  without referring to any particular case. It must be added, that although
  there are <i>caustics</i> in mathematics, there is no <i>lunar</i>
  caustic.</p>

  <p>So far as Mr. Goulburn was concerned, the above was poetic justice. He
  was the minister who, in old time, told a deputation from the
  Astronomical Society that the Government "did not care twopence for all
  the science in the country." There may be some still alive who remember
  this: I heard it from more than one of those who were present, and are
  now gone. Matters are much changed. I was thirty years in office at the
  Astronomical Society; and, to my certain knowledge, every Government of
  that period, Whig and Tory, showed itself ready to help with influence
  when wanted, and with money whenever there was an answer for the House of
  Commons. The following correction subsequently appeared. Referring to the
  hoax about Mr. Goulburn, Messrs. C.&nbsp;H. and Thompson Cooper<a
  name="NtA_625" href="#Nt_625"><sup>[625]</sup></a> have corrected an
  error, by stating that the election which gave rise to the hoax was that

  Gunning, the well-known Esquire Bedell of the University, attributed the
  hoax to the late Rev. R. Sheepshanks, to whom, they state, are also
  attributed certain clever fictitious biographies&mdash;of public men, as
  I understand it&mdash;which were palmed upon the editor of the
  <i>Cambridge Chronicle</i>, who never suspected their genuineness to the
  day of his death. Being in most confidential intercourse with Mr.
  Sheepshanks,<a name="NtA_629" href="#Nt_629"><sup>[629]</sup></a> both at
  the time and all the rest of his life (twenty-five years), and never
  heard him allude to any such things&mdash;which were not in his line,
  though he had satirical power of quite another <!-- Page 291 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page291"></a>[291]</span>kind&mdash;I feel
  satisfied he had nothing to do with them. I may add that others, his
  nearest friends, and also members of his family, never heard him allude
  to these hoaxes as their author, and disbelieve his authorship as much as
  I do myself. I say this not as imputing any blame to the true author,
  such hoaxes being fair election jokes in all time, but merely to put the
  saddle off the wrong horse, and to give one more instance of the
  insecurity of imputed authorship. Had Mr. Sheepshanks ever told me that
  he had perpetrated the hoax, I should have had no hesitation in giving it
  to him. I consider all clever election squibs, free from bitterness and
  personal imputation, as giving the multitude good channels for the vent
  of feelings which but for them would certainly find bad ones.</p>

  <p>[But I now suspect that Mr. Babbage<a name="NtA_630"
  href="#Nt_630"><sup>[630]</sup></a> had some hand in the hoax. He gives
  it in his "Passages, &amp;c." and is evidently writing from memory, for
  he gives the wrong year. But he has given the paragraph, though not
  accurately, yet with such a recollection of the points as brings
  suspicion of the authorship upon him, perhaps in conjunction with D.&nbsp;B.<a

  Cavendish's committee. Mr. Babbage adds, that "late one evening a cab
  drove up in hot haste to the office of the <i>Morning Post</i>, delivered
  the copy as coming from Mr. Goulburn's committee, and at the same time
  ordered fifty extra copies of the <i>Post</i> to be sent next morning to
  their committee-room." I think the man&mdash;the only one I ever heard
  of&mdash;who knew all about the cab and the extra copies must have known
  more.]</p>

<p class="cenhead">ON M. DEMONVILLE.</p>

  <p><i>Demonville.</i>&mdash;A Frenchman's Christian name is his own
  secret, unless there be two of the surname. M. Demonville is a very good
  instance of the difference between a <!-- Page 292 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page292"></a>[292]</span>French and English
  discoverer. In England there is a public to listen to discoveries in
  mathematical subjects made without mathematics: a public which will hear,
  and wonder, and think it possible that the pretensions of the discoverer
  have some foundation. The unnoticed man may possibly be right: and the
  old country-town reputation which I once heard of, attaching to a man who
  "had written a book about the signs of the zodiac which all the
  philosophers in London could not answer," is fame as far as it goes.
  Accordingly, we have plenty of discoverers who, even in astronomy,
  pronounce the learned in error because of mathematics. In France, beyond
  the sphere of influence of the Academy of Sciences, there is no one to
  cast a thought upon the matter: all who take the least interest repose
  entire faith in the Institute. Hence the French discoverer turns all his
  thoughts to the Institute, and looks for his only hearing in that
  quarter. He therefore throws no slur upon the means of knowledge, but
  would say, with M. Demonville: "A l'égard de M. Poisson,<a name="NtA_632"

  are prerogatives of deity. But <i>nothing</i> multiplied by
  <i>nothing</i> is <i>one</i>. M. Demonville obtained an introduction to
  William the Fourth, who desired the opinion of the Royal Society upon his

  miniature painting.' Submitted to the consideration of the Royal Society,
  on whose protection the author humbly throws himself. London, 1832,
  8vo.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Mr. Parsey was an artist, who also made himself conspicuous by a new
  view of perspective. Seeing that the sides of a tower, for instance,
  would appear to meet in a point if the tower were high enough, he thought
  that these sides ought to slope to one another in the picture. On this
  <!-- Page 294 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page294"></a>[294]</span>theory he published a small work, of which
  I have not the title, with a Grecian temple in the frontispiece, stated,
  if I remember rightly, to be the first picture which had ever been drawn
  in true perspective. Of course the building looked very Egyptian, with
  its sloping sides. The answer to his notion is easy enough. What is
  called the picture is not the picture from which the mind takes its
  perception; that picture is on the retina. The <i>intermediate</i>
  picture, as it may be called&mdash;the human artist's work&mdash;is
  itself seen perspectively. If the tower were so high that the sides,
  though parallel, appeared to meet in a point, the picture must also be so
  high that the <i>picture-sides</i>, though parallel, would appear to meet
  in a point. I never saw this answer given, though I have seen and heard
  the remarks of artists on Mr. Parsey's work. I am inclined to think it is
  commonly supposed that the artist's picture is the representation which
  comes before the mind: this is not true; we might as well say the same of
  the object itself. In July 1831, reading an article on squaring the
  circle, and finding that there was a difficulty, he set to work, got a
  light denied to all mathematicians in&mdash;some would say
  through&mdash;a crack, and advertised in the <i>Times</i> that he had
  done the trick. He then prepared this work, in which, those who read it
  will see how, he showed that 3.14159... should be 3.0625. He might have
  found out his error by <i>stepping</i> a draughtsman's circle with the
  compasses.</p>

  <p>Perspective has not had many paradoxes. The only other one I remember
  is that of a writer on perspective, whose name I forget, and whose four
  pages I do not possess. He circulated remarks on my notes on the subject,
  published in the <i>Athenæum</i>, in which he denies that the
  stereographic projection is a case of perspective, the reason being that
  the whole hemisphere makes too large a picture for the eye conveniently
  to grasp at once. That is to say, it is no perspective because there is
  too much perspective. <!-- Page 295 --><span class="pagenum"><a

</blockquote>

  <p>These works belong to a small class which have the peculiarity of
  insisting that in the general propositions of geometry a proposition
  gives its converse: that "Every B is A" follows from "Every A is B." Dr.
  Ritchie says, "If it be proved that the equality of two of the angles of
  a triangle depends <i>essentially</i> upon the equality of the opposite
  sides, it follows that the equality of opposite sides depends
  <i>essentially</i> on the equality of the angles." Dr. Day puts it as
  follows:</p>

  <p>"That the converses of Euclid, so called, where no particular
  limitation is specified or implied in the leading proposition, more than
  in the converse, must be necessarily true; for as by the nature of the
  reasoning the leading proposition must be universally true, should the
  converse be not so, it cannot be so universally, but has at least all the
  exceptions conveyed in the leading proposition, and the case is therefore
  unadapted to geometric reasoning; or, what is the same thing, by the very
  nature of geometric reasoning, the particular exceptions to the extended
  converse must be identical with some one or other of the cases under the
  universal affirmative proposition with which we set forth, which is
  absurd."</p>

<p><!-- Page 296 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page296"></a>[296]</span></p>

  <p>On this I cannot help transferring to my reader the words of the Pacha
  when he orders the bastinado,&mdash;May it do you good! A rational study
  of logic is much wanted to show many mathematicians, of all degrees of
  proficiency, that there is nothing in the <i>reasoning</i> of mathematics
  which differs from other reasoning. Dr. Day repeated his argument in <i>A
  Treatise on Proportion</i>, London, 1840, 8vo. Dr. Ritchie was a very
  clear-headed man. He published, in 1818, a work on arithmetic, with
  rational explanations. This was too early for such an improvement, and
  nearly the whole of his excellent work was sold as waste paper. His
  elementary introduction to the Differential Calculus was drawn up while
  he was learning the subject late in life. Books of this sort are often
  very effective on points of difficulty.</p>

  showed a resident a remarkable blood-red star, and some little time after
  he heard of a sermon preached in those parts in which it was asserted

  href="#Nt_655"><sup>[655]</sup></a> dated April 3, 1787, and signed
  "Eliza Cumyns," begging to know if any of the stars be <i>indigo</i> in

  conjectural illustration of the expression, so often used by our Saviour
  in the Holy Gospels, that 'the disobedient shall be cast into outer
  darkness'; for as the Almighty Being can doubtless confine any of his
  creatures, whether corporeal or spiritual, to what part of his creation
  He pleases, if therefore any of the stars (which are beyond all doubt so
  many suns to other systems) be of so dark a color as that above
  mentioned, they may be calculated to give the most insufferable heat to
  those dolorous systems dependent upon them (and to reprobate spirits
  placed there), without one ray of cheerful light; and may therefore be
  the scenes of future punishments." This letter is addressed to Dr.
  Heirschel at Slow. Some have placed the infernal regions inside the

<p class="cenhead">THE NAUTICAL ALMANAC.</p>

  <p>1834. From 1769 to 1834 the <i>Nautical Almanac</i> was published on a
  plan which gradually fell behind what was wanted. In 1834 the new series
  began, under a new superintendent (Lieut. W.&nbsp;S. Stratford).<a
  name="NtA_656" href="#Nt_656"><sup>[656]</sup></a> There had been a long
  scientific controversy, which would not be generally intelligible. To set
  some of the points before the reader, I reprint a cutting which I have by
  me. It is from the Nautical <i>Magazine</i>, but I did hear that some had
  an idea that it was in the Nautical <i>Almanac</i> itself. It certainly
  was not, and I feel satisfied the Lords of the Admiralty would not have
  permitted the insertion; they are never in advance of their age. The
  Almanac for 1834 was published in July 1833.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p><span class="sc">The New Nautical Almanac</span>&mdash;Extract from
  the 'Primum Mobile,' and 'Milky Way Gazette.' Communicated by <span
  class="sc">Aerolith</span>.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>A meeting of the different bodies composing the Solar System was this
  day held at the Dragon's Tail, for the purpose of taking into
  consideration the alterations and amendments introduced into the New
  Nautical Almanac. The honorable luminaries had been individually summoned
  <!-- Page 301 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page301"></a>[301]</span>by fast-sailing comets, and there was a
  remarkably full attendance. Among the visitors we <i>observed</i> several
  nebulæ, and almost all the stars whose proper motions would admit of
  their being present.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Sun</span> was unanimously called to the focus.
  The small planets took the oaths, and their places, after a short
  discussion, in which it was decided that the places should be those of
  the Almanac itself, with leave reserved to move for corrections.</p>

  <p>Petitions were presented from <span class="grk">&alpha;</span> and
  <span class="grk">&delta;</span> Ursæ Minoris, complaining of being put
  on daily duty, and praying for an increase of salary.&mdash;Laid on the
  plane of the ecliptic.</p>

  <p>The trustees of the eccentricity<a name="NtA_657"
  href="#Nt_657"><sup>[657]</sup></a> and inclination funds reported a
  balance of .00001 in the former, and a deficit of 0".009 in the latter.
  This announcement caused considerable surprise, and a committee was moved
  for, to ascertain which of the bodies had more or less than his share.
  After some discussion, in which the small planets offered to consent to a
  reduction, if necessary, the motion was carried.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Focal Body</span> then rose to address the
  meeting. He remarked that the subject on which they were assembled was
  one of great importance to the routes and revolutions of the heavenly
  bodies. For himself, though a private arrangement between two of his
  honourable neighbours (here he looked hard at the Earth and Venus) had
  prevented his hitherto paying that close attention to the predictions of
  the Nautical Almanac which he declared he always had wished to do; yet he
  felt consoled by knowing that the conductors of that work had every
  disposition to take his peculiar circumstances into consideration. He
  declared that he had never passed the wires of a transit without deeply
  feeling his inability to adapt himself to the present state of his
  theory; a feeling which he was afraid had sometimes caused a slight
  tremor in his limb. Before <!-- Page 302 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page302"></a>[302]</span>he sat down, he expressed a hope that
  honourable luminaries would refrain as much as possible from eclipsing
  each other, or causing mutual <span class="correction" title="text reads `peturbations'"
  >perturbations</span>. Indeed, he should be very sorry to see any
  interruption of the harmony of the spheres. (Applause.)</p>

  <p>The several articles of the New Nautical Almanac were then read over
  without any comment; only we observed that Saturn shook his ring at every
  novelty, and Jupiter gave his belt a hitch, and winked at the satellites
  at page 21 of each month.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Moon</span> rose to propose a resolution. No one,
  he said, would be surprised at his bringing this matter forward in the
  way he did, when it was considered in how complete and satisfactory a
  manner his motions were now represented. He must own he had trembled when
  the Lords of the Admiralty dissolved the Board of Longitude, but his
  tranquillity was more than reestablished by the adoption of the new
  system. He did not know but that any little assistance he could give in
  Nautical Astronomy was becoming of less and less value every day, owing
  to the improvement of chronometers. But there was one thing, of which
  nothing could deprive him&mdash;he meant the regulation of the tides.
  And, perhaps, when his attention was not occupied by more than the
  latter, he should be able to introduce a little more regularity into the
  phenomena. (Here the honourable luminary gave a sort of modest libration,
  which convulsed the meeting with laughter.) They might laugh at his
  natural infirmity if they pleased, but he could assure them it arose only
  from the necessity he was under, when young, of watching the motions of
  his worthy primary. He then moved a resolution highly laudatory of the
  alterations which appeared in the New Nautical Almanac.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Earth</span> rose, to second the motion. His
  honourable satellite had fully expressed his opinions on the subject. He
  joined his honourable friend in the focus in wishing to pay every
  attention to the Nautical Almanac, but, <!-- Page 303 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page303"></a>[303]</span>really, when so
  important an alteration had taken place in his magnetic pole<a
  name="NtA_658" href="#Nt_658"><sup>[658]</sup></a> (hear) and there
  might, for aught he knew, be a successful attempt to reach his pole of
  rotation, he thought he could not answer for the preservation of the
  precession in its present state. (Here the hon. luminary, scratching his
  side, exclaimed, as he sat down, "More steamboats&mdash;confound
  'em!")</p>

  <p>An honourable satellite (whose name we could not learn) proposed that
  the resolution should be immediately despatched, corrected for
  refraction, when he was called to order by the Focal Body, who reminded
  him that it was contrary to the moving orders of the system to take
  cognizance of what passed inside the atmosphere of any planet.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Saturn</span> and <span class="sc">Pallas</span> rose
  together. (Cries of "New member!" and the former gave way.) The latter,
  in a long and eloquent speech, praised the liberality with which he and
  his colleagues had at length been relieved from astronomical
  disqualifications. He thought that it was contrary to the spirit of the
  laws of gravitation to exclude any planet from office on account of the
  eccentricity or inclination of his orbit. Honourable luminaries need not
  talk of the want of convergency of his series. What had they to do with
  any private arrangements between him and the general equations of the
  system? (Murmurs from the opposition.) So long as he obeyed the laws of
  motion, to which he had that day taken a solemn oath, he would ask, were
  old planets, which were now so well known that nobody trusted them,
  to....</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Focal Body</span> said he was sorry to break the
  continuity of the proceedings, but he thought that remarks upon
  character, with a negative sign, would introduce <!-- Page 304 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page304"></a>[304]</span>differences of too high
  an order. The honourable luminary must eliminate the expression which he
  had brought out, in finite terms, and use smaller inequalities in future.
  (Hear, hear.)</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Pallas</span> explained, that he was far from meaning
  to reflect upon the orbital character of any planet present. He only
  meant to protest against being judged by any laws but those of
  gravitation, and the differential calculus: he thought it most unjust
  that astronomers should prevent the small planets from being observed,
  and then reproach them with the imperfections of the tables, which were
  the result of their own narrow-minded policy. (Cheers.)</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Saturn</span> thought that, as an old planet, he had
  not been treated with due respect. (Hear, from his satellites.) He had
  long foretold the wreck of the system from the friends of innovation.
  Why, he might ask, were his satellites to be excluded, when small
  planets, trumpery comets, which could not keep their mean distances
  (cries of oh! oh!), double stars, with graphical approximations, and such
  obscure riff-raff of the heavens (great uproar) found room enough. So
  help him Arithmetic, nothing could come of it, but a stoppage of all
  revolution. His hon. friend in the focus might smile, for he would be a
  gainer by such an event; but as for him (Saturn), he had something to
  lose, and hon. luminaries well knew that, whatever they might think
  <i>under</i> an atmosphere, <i>above</i> it continual revolution was the
  only way of preventing perpetual anarchy. As to the hon. luminary who had
  risen before him, he was not surprised at his remarks, for he had
  invariably observed that he and his colleagues allowed themselves <i>too
  much latitude</i>. The stability of the system required that they should
  be brought down, and he, for one, would exert all his powers of
  attraction to accomplish that end. If other bodies would cordially unite
  with him, particularly his noble friend next him, than whom no luminary
  possessed greater weight&mdash;</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Jupiter</span> rose to order. He conceived his noble
  friend <!-- Page 305 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page305"></a>[305]</span>had no right to allude to him in that
  manner, and was much surprised at his proposal, considering the matters
  which remained in dispute between them. In the present state of affairs,
  he would take care never to be in conjunction with his hon. neighbour one
  moment longer than he could help. (Cries of "Order, order, no long
  inequalities," during which he sat down.)</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Saturn</span> proceeded to say, that he did not know
  till then that a planet with a ring could affront one who had only a
  belt, by proposing mutual co-operation. He would now come to the subject
  under discussion. He should think meanly of his hon. colleagues if they
  consented to bestow their approbation upon a mere astronomical
  production. Had they forgotten that they once were considered the
  arbiters of fate, and the prognosticators of man's destiny? What had lost
  them that proud position? Was it not the infernal march of intellect,
  which, after having turned the earth topsy-turvy, was now disturbing the
  very universe? For himself (others might do as they pleased), but he
  stuck to the venerable Partridge,<a name="NtA_659"
  href="#Nt_659"><sup>[659]</sup></a> and the Stationers' Company, and
  trusted that they would outlive infidels and anarchists, whether of
  Astronomical or Diffusion of Knowledge Societies. (Cries of oh! oh!)</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Mars</span> said he had been told, for he must
  confess he had not seen the work, that the places of the planets were
  given for Sundays. This, he must be allowed to say, was an indecorum he
  had not expected; and he was convinced the Lords of the Admiralty had
  given no orders to that effect. He hoped this point would be considered
  in the measure which had been introduced in another place, and that some
  <!-- Page 306 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page306"></a>[306]</span>one would move that the prohibition
  against travelling on Sundays extend to the heavenly as well as earthly
  bodies.</p>

  <p>Several of the stars here declared, that they had been much annoyed by
  being observed on Sunday evenings, during the hours of divine
  service.</p>

  <p>The room was then cleared for a division, but we are unable to state
  what took place. Several comets-at-arms were sent for, and we heard
  rumors of a personal collision having taken place between two luminaries
  in opposition. We were afterwards told that the resolution was carried by
  a majority, and the luminaries elongated at 2 h. 15 m. 33,41 s. sidereal
  time.</p>

  <p>* * * It is reported, but we hope without foundation, that Saturn, and
  several other discontented planets, have accepted an invitation from
  Sirius to join his system, on the most liberal appointments. We believe
  the report to have originated in nothing more than the discovery of the
  annual parallax of Sirius from the orbit of Saturn; but we may safely
  assure our readers that no steps have as yet been taken to open any
  communication.</p>

  <p>We are also happy to state, that there is no truth in the rumor of the
  laws of gravitation being about to be repealed. We have traced this
  report, and find it originated with a gentleman living near Bath (Captain
  Forman, R.N),<a name="NtA_660" href="#Nt_660"><sup>[660]</sup></a> whose
  name we forbear to mention.</p>

  <p>A great excitement has been observed among the nebulæ, visible to the
  earth's southern hemisphere, particularly among those which have not yet
  been discovered from thence. We are at a loss to conjecture the cause,
  but we shall not fail to report to our readers the news of any movement
  which may take place. (Sir J. Herschel's visit. He could just see this
  before he went out.)</p>

  <p>I think this divine system was published several years before, and was
  republished with an introduction in 1834.<a name="NtA_663"
  href="#Nt_663"><sup>[663]</sup></a> Capt. Woodley was very sure that the
  earth does not move: he pointed out to me, in a conversation I had with
  him, something&mdash;I forget what&mdash;in the motion of the Great Bear,
  visible to any eye, which could not possibly be if the earth moved. He
  was exceedingly ignorant, as the following quotation from his account of
  the usual opinion will show:</p>

  <p>"The north pole of the Earth's axis deserts, they say, the north star
  or pole of the Heavens, at the rate of 1° in 71¾ years.... The fact is,
  nothing can be more certain than that the Stars have not changed their
  latitudes or declinations <i>one degree</i> in the last 71¾ years."</p>

  <p>This is a strong specimen of a class of men by whom all accessible
  persons who have made any name in science are hunted. It is a pity that
  they cannot be admitted into scientific societies, and allowed fairly to
  state their cases, and stand quiet cross-examination, being kept in their
  answers very close to the questions, and the answers written down. I am
  perfectly satisfied that if one meeting in the year were devoted to the
  hearing of those who chose to come forward on such conditions, much good
  would be done. But I strongly suspect few would come forward <!-- Page
  308 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page308"></a>[308]</span>at first,
  and none in a little while: and I have had some experience of the method
  I recommend, privately tried. Capt. Woodley was proposed, a little after
  1834, as a Fellow of the Astronomical Society; and, not caring whether he
  moved the sun or the earth, or both&mdash;I could not have stood
  <i>neither</i>&mdash;I signed the proposal. I always had a sneaking
  kindness for paradoxers, such a one, perhaps, as Petit André had for his
  <i>lambs</i>, as he called them. There was so little feeling against his
  opinions, that he only failed by a fraction of a ball. Had I myself
  voted, he would have been elected; but being engaged in conversation, and
  not having heard the slightest objection to him, I did not think it worth
  while to cross the room for the purpose. I regretted this at the time,
  but had I known how ignorant he was I should not have supported him.
  Probably those who voted against him knew more of his book than I
  did.</p>

  <p>I remember no other instance of exclusion from a scientific society on
  the ground of opinion, even if this be one; of which it may be that
  ignorance had more to do with it than paradoxy. Mr. Frend,<a
  name="NtA_664" href="#Nt_664"><sup>[664]</sup></a> a strong
  anti-Newtonian, was a Fellow of the Astronomical Society, and for some
  years in the Council. Lieut. Kerigan<a name="NtA_665"
  href="#Nt_665"><sup>[665]</sup></a> was elected to the Royal Society at a
  time when his proposers must have known that his immediate object was to
  put F.R.S. on the title-page of a work against the tides. To give all I
  know, I may add that the editor of some very ignorant bombast about the
  "forehead of the solar sky," who did not know the difference between
  <i>Bailly</i><a name="NtA_666" href="#Nt_666"><sup>[666]</sup></a> and
  <i>Baily</i>,<a name="NtA_667" href="#Nt_667"><sup>[667]</sup></a>
  received hints which induced him to withdraw his proposal for election
  into the Astronomical Society. But this was an act of kindness; <!-- Page

  <p>My friend Francis Baily was a paradoxer: he brought forward things
  counter to universal opinion. That Newton was impeccable in every point
  was the national creed; and failings of temper and conduct would have
  been utterly disbelieved, if the paradox had not come supported by very
  unusual evidence. Anybody who impeached Newton on existing evidence might
  as well have been squaring the circle, for any attention he would have
  got. About this book I will tell a story. It was published by the
  Admiralty for distribution; and the distribution was entrusted to Mr.
  Baily. On the eve of its appearance, rumors of its extraordinary
  revelations got about, and persons of influence applied to the Admiralty
  for copies. The Lords were in a difficulty: but on looking at the list
  they saw names, as they <!-- Page 310 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page310"></a>[310]</span>thought, which were so obscure that they
  had a right to assume Mr. Baily had included persons who had no claim to
  such a compliment as presentation from the Admiralty. The Secretary
  requested Mr. Baily to call upon him. "Mr. Baily, my Lords are inclined
  to think that some of the persons in this list are perhaps not of that
  note which would justify their Lordships in presenting this
  work."&mdash;"To whom does your observation apply, Mr.
  Secretary?"&mdash;"Well, now, let us examine the list; let me see;
  now,&mdash;now,&mdash;now,&mdash;come!&mdash;here's Gauss<a
  name="NtA_671" href="#Nt_671"><sup>[671]</sup></a>&mdash;<i>who's
  Gauss</i>?"&mdash;"Gauss, Mr. Secretary, is the oldest mathematician now
  living, and is generally thought to be the greatest."&mdash;"O-o-oh!
  Well, Mr. Baily, we will see about it, and I will write you a letter."
  The letter expressed their Lordships' perfect satisfaction with the
  list.</p>

  <p>There was a controversy about the revelations made in this work; but
  as the eccentric anomalies took no part in it, there is nothing for my
  purpose. The following valentine from Mrs. Flamsteed,<a name="NtA_672"
  href="#Nt_672"><sup>[672]</sup></a> which I found among Baily's papers,
  illustrates some of the points:</p>

  <p class="author">"3 Astronomers' Row, Paradise: February 14, 1836.

  <p>"Dear Sir,&mdash;I suppose you hardly expected to receive a letter
  from me, dated from this place; but the truth is, a gentleman from our
  street was appointed guardian angel to the American Treaty, in which
  there is some astronomical question about boundaries. He has got leave to
  go back to fetch some instruments which he left behind, and I take this
  opportunity of making your acquaintance. That America has become a
  wonderful place since I was down among you; you have no idea how grand
  the fire at New York <!-- Page 311 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page311"></a>[311]</span>looked up here. Poor dear Mr. Flamsteed
  does not know I am writing a letter to a gentleman on Valentine's day; he
  is walked out with Sir Isaac Newton (they are pretty good friends now,
  though they do squabble a little sometimes) and Sir William Herschel, to
  see a new nebula. Sir Isaac says he can't make out at all how it is
  managed; and I am sure I cannot help him. I never bothered my head about
  those things down below, and I don't intend to begin here.</p>

  <p>"I have just received the news of your having written a book about my
  poor dear man. It's a chance that I heard it at all; for the truth is,
  the scientific gentlemen are somehow or other become so wicked, and go so
  little to church, that very few of them are considered fit company for
  this place. If it had not been for Dr. Brinkley,<a name="NtA_673"
  href="#Nt_673"><sup>[673]</sup></a> who came here of course, I should not
  have heard about it. He seems a nice man, but is not yet used to our
  ways. As to Mr. Halley,<a name="NtA_674"
  href="#Nt_674"><sup>[674]</sup></a> he is of course not here; which is
  lucky for him, for Mr. Flamsteed swore the moment he caught him in a
  place where there are no magistrates, he would make a sacrifice of him to
  heavenly truth. It was very generous in Mr. F. not appearing against Sir
  Isaac when he came up, for I am told that if he had, Sir Isaac would not
  have been allowed to come in at all. I should have been sorry for that,
  for he is a companionable man enough, only holds his head rather higher
  than he should do. I met him the other day walking with Mr. Whiston,<a
  name="NtA_675" href="#Nt_675"><sup>[675]</sup></a> and disputing about
  the deluge. 'Well, Mrs. Flamsteed,' says he, 'does old Poke-the-Stars
  understand gravitation yet?' Now you must know that is rather a sore
  point with poor dear Mr. Flamsteed. He says that Sir Isaac is as
  crochetty about the moon as ever; and as to <!-- Page 312 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page312"></a>[312]</span>what some people say
  about what has been done since his time, he says he should like to see
  somebody who knows something about it of himself. For it is very singular
  that none of the people who have carried on Sir Isaac's notions have been
  allowed to come here.</p>

  <p>"I hope you have not forgotten to tell how badly Sir Isaac used Mr.
  Flamsteed about that book. I have never quite forgiven him; as for Mr.
  Flamsteed, he says that as long as he does not come for observations, he
  does not care about it, and that he will never trust him with any papers
  again as long as he lives. I shall never forget what a rage he came home
  in when Sir Isaac had called him a puppy. He struck the stairs all the
  way up with his crutch, and said puppy at every step, and all the
  evening, as soon as ever a star appeared in the telescope, he called it
  puppy. I could not think what was the matter, and when I asked, he only
  called me puppy.</p>

  <p>"I shall be very glad to see you if you come our way. Pray keep up
  some appearances, and go to church a little. St. Peter is always
  uncommonly civil to astronomers, and indeed to all scientific persons,
  and never bothers them with many questions. If they can make anything out
  of the case, he is sure to let them in. Indeed, he says, it is perfectly
  out of the question expecting a mathematician to be as religious as an
  apostle, but that it is as much as his place is worth to let in the
  greater number of those who come. So try if you cannot manage it, for I
  am very curious to know whether you found all the letters. I remain, dear
  sir, your faithful servant,</p>

  <p>The Secretary of the Admiralty was completely extinguished. I can
  recall but two instances of demolition as complete, though no doubt there
  are many others. The first is in</p>

  <div class="poem">

      <p>Simon Stevin<a name="NtA_678" href="#Nt_678"><sup>[678]</sup></a> and M. Dumortier. Nieuport, 1845, 12mo.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>M. Dumortier was a member of the Academy of Brussels: there was a
  discussion, I believe, about a national Pantheon for Belgium. The name of
  Stevinus suggested itself as naturally as that of Newton to an
  Englishman; probably no Belgian is better known to foreigners as
  illustrious in science. Stevinus is great in the <i>Mécanique
  Analytique</i> of Lagrange;<a name="NtA_679"
  href="#Nt_679"><sup>[679]</sup></a> Stevinus is great in the <i>Tristram
  Shandy</i> of Sterne. M. Dumortier, who believed that not one Belgian in
  a thousand knew Stevinus, and who confesses with ironical shame that he
  was not the odd man, protested against placing the statue of an obscure
  man in the Pantheon, to give foreigners the notion that Belgium could
  show nothing greater. The work above named is a slashing retort: any one
  who knows the history of science ever so little may imagine what a
  dressing was given, by mere extract from foreign writers. The tract is a
  letter signed J. du Fan, but this is a pseudonym of Mr. Van de Weyer.<a
  name="NtA_680" href="#Nt_680"><sup>[680]</sup></a> The Academician says
  Stevinus was a man who was not <!-- Page 314 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  lived: Sir! is the answer, he was as much before his own time as you are
  behind yours. How came a man who had never heard of Stevinus to be a
  member of the Brussels Academy?</p>

  <p>The second story was told me by Mr. Crabb Robinson,<a name="NtA_681"

  you not move? You deserve a good hiding, and you shall get it if you
  don't take care!" The bumpkin raised his muscular figure on its feet,
  patted his menacer on the head, and said, very quietly,&mdash;"Young man!

  seized the great pugilist's hand, and shook it warmly, got him to his own

  lasted until the large end of the small hours.</p>

</blockquote>

<p><!-- Page 315 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page315"></a>[315]</span></p>

  <p>This writer, by his own account, succeeded in delivering the famous
  Lieut. Richard Brothers<a name="NtA_685"
  href="#Nt_685"><sup>[685]</sup></a> from the lunatic asylum, and tending
  him, not as a keeper but as a disciple, till he died. Brothers was, by
  his own account, the nephew of the Almighty, and Finleyson ought to have
  been the nephew of Brothers. For Napoleon came to him in a vision, with a
  broken sword and an arrow in his side, beseeching help: Finleyson pulled
  out the arrow, but refused to give a new sword; whereby poor Napoleon,
  though he got off with life, lost the battle of Waterloo. This story was
  written to the Duke of Wellington, ending with "I pulled out the arrow,
  but left the broken sword. Your Grace can supply the rest, and what
  followed is amply recorded in history." The book contains a long account
  of applications to Government to do three things: to pay 2,000<i>l.</i>
  for care taken of Brothers, to pay 10,000<i>l.</i> for discovery of the
  longitude, and to prohibit the teaching of the Newtonian system, which
  makes God a liar. The successive administrations were threatened that
  they would have to turn out if they refused, which, it is remarked, came
  to pass in every case. I have heard of a joke of Lord Macaulay, that the
  House of Commons must be the Beast of the Revelations, since 658 members,
  with the officers necessary for the action of the House, make 666.
  Macaulay read most things, and the greater part of the rest: so that he
  might be suspected of having appropriated as a joke one of Finleyson's
  serious points&mdash;"I wrote Earl Grey<a name="NtA_686"
  href="#Nt_686"><sup>[686]</sup></a> upon the 13th of July, 1831,
  informing him that his Reform <!-- Page 316 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page316"></a>[316]</span>Bill could not be carried, as it reduced
  the members below the present amount of 658, which, with the eight
  principal clerks or officers of the House, make the number 666." But a
  witness has informed me that Macaulay's joke was made in his hearing a
  great many years before the Reform Bill was proposed; in fact, when both
  were students at Cambridge. Earl Grey was, according to Finleyson, a
  descendant of Uriah the Hittite. For a specimen of Lieut. Brothers, this
  book would be worth picking up. Perhaps a specimen of the Lieutenant's
  poetry may be acceptable: Brothers <i>loquitur</i>, remember:</p>

<p class="cenhead">ON THEOLOGICAL PARADOXERS.</p>

  <p>Among the paradoxers are some of the theologians who in their own
  organs of the press venture to criticise science. These may hold their
  ground when they confine themselves to the geology of long past periods
  and to general cosmogony: for it is the tug of Greek against Greek; and
  both sides deal much in what is grand when called <i>hypothesis</i>,
  petty when called <i>supposition</i>. And very often they are not
  conspicuous when they venture upon things within knowledge; <!-- Page 317
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page317"></a>[317]</span>wrong, but not
  quite wrong enough for a Budget of Paradoxes. One case, however, is
  destined to live, as an instance of a school which finds writers,
  editors, and readers. The double stars have been seen from the
  seventeenth century, and diligently observed by many from the time of Wm.
  Herschel, who first devoted continuous attention to them. The year 1836
  was that of a remarkable triumph of astronomical prediction. The theory
  of gravitation had been applied to the motion of binary stars about each
  other, in elliptic orbits, and in that year the two stars of <span
  class="grk">&gamma;</span> Virginis, as had been predicted should happen
  within a few years of that time&mdash;for years are small quantities in
  such long revolutions&mdash;the two stars came to their nearest: in fact,
  they appeared to be one as much with the telescope as without it. This
  remarkable turning-point of the history of a long and widely-known branch
  of astronomy was followed by an article in the <i>Church of England
  Quarterly Review</i> for April 1837, written against the Useful Knowledge
  Society. The notion that there are any such things as double stars is (p.
  460) implied to be imposture or delusion, as in the following extract. I
  suspect that I myself am the <i>Sidrophel</i>, and that my companion to
  the maps of the stars, written for the Society and published in 1836, is
  the work to which the writer refers:</p>

  <p>"We have forgotten the name of that Sidrophel who lately discovered
  that the fixed stars were not single stars, but appear in the heavens
  like soles at Billingsgate, in pairs; while a second astronomer, under
  the influence of that competition in trade which the political economists
  tell us is so advantageous to the public, professes to show us, through
  his superior telescope, that the apparently single stars are really
  three. Before such wondrous mandarins of science, how continually must
  <i>homunculi</i> like ourselves keep in the background, lest we come
  between the wind and their nobility."</p>

  <p>If the <i>homunculus</i> who wrote this be still above ground, <!--
  Page 318 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page318"></a>[318]</span>how
  devoutly must he hope he may be able to keep in the background! But the
  chief blame falls on the editor. The title of the article is:</p>

  <p>"The new school of superficial pantology; a speech intended to be
  delivered before a defunct Mechanics' Institute. By Swallow Swift, late
  M.P. for the Borough of Cockney-Cloud, Witsbury: reprinted Balloon
  Island, Bubble year, month <i>Ventose</i>. Long live Charlatan!"</p>

  <p>As a rule, orthodox theologians should avoid humor, a weapon which all
  history shows to be very difficult to employ in favor of establishment,
  and which, nine times out of ten, leaves its wielder fighting on the side
  of heterodoxy. Theological argument, when not enlivened by bigotry, is
  seldom worse than narcotic: but theological fun, when not covert heresy,
  is almost always sialagogue. The article in question is a craze, which no
  editor should have admitted, except after severe inspection by qualified
  persons. The author of this wit committed a mistake which occurs now and
  then in old satire, the confusion between himself and the party aimed at.
  He ought to be reviewing this fictitious book, but every now and then the
  article becomes the book itself; not by quotation, but by the writer
  forgetting that <i>he</i> is not Mr. Swallow Swift, but his reviewer. In
  fact he and Mr. S. Swift had each had a dose of the <i>Devil's
  Elixir</i>. A novel so called, published about forty years ago, proceeds
  upon a legend of this kind. If two parties both drink of the elixir,
  their identities get curiously intermingled; each turns up in the
  character of the other throughout the three volumes, without having his
  ideas clear as to whether he be himself or the other. There is a similar
  confusion in the answer made to the famous <i>Epistolæ Obscurorum
  Virorum</i>:<a name="NtA_687" href="#Nt_687"><sup>[687]</sup></a> it is
  headed <i>Lamentationes Obscurorum Virorum</i>.<a name="NtA_688"
  href="#Nt_688"><sup>[688]</sup></a> <!-- Page 319 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page319"></a>[319]</span>This is not a retort of
  the writer, throwing back the imputation: the obscure men who had been
  satirized are themselves made, by name, to wince under the disapprobation
  which the Pope had expressed at the satire upon themselves.</p>

  <p>Of course the book here reviewed is a transparent forgery. But I do
  not know how often it may have happened that the book, in the journals
  which always put a title at the head, may have been written after the
  review. About the year 1830 a friend showed me the proof of an article of
  his on the malt tax, for the next number of the <i>Edinburgh Review</i>.
  Nothing was wanting except the title of the book reviewed; I asked what
  it was. He sat down, and wrote as follows at the head, "The Maltster's
  Guide (pp. 124)," and said that would do as well as anything.</p>

  <p>But I myself, it will be remarked, have employed such humor as I can
  command "in favor of establishment." What it is worth I am not to judge;
  as usual in such cases, those who are of my cabal pronounce it good, but
  cyclometers and other paradoxers either call it very poor, or commend it
  as sheer buffoonery. Be it one or the other, I observe that all the
  effective ridicule is, in this subject, on the side of establishment.
  This is partly due to the difficulty of quizzing plain and sober
  demonstration; but so much, if not more, to the ignorance of the
  paradoxers. For that which cannot be <i>ridiculed</i>, can be <i>turned
  into ridicule</i> by those who know how. But by the time a person is deep
  enough in <i>negative</i> quantities, and <i>impossible</i> quantities,
  to be able to satirize them, he is caught, and being inclined to become a
  <i>user</i>, shrinks from being an <i>abuser</i>. Imagine a person with a
  gift of ridicule, and knowledge enough, trying his hand on the junction
  of the assertions which he will find in various books of algebra. First,
  that a negative quantity has no logarithm; secondly, that a <!-- Page 320
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page320"></a>[320]</span>negative
  quantity has no square root; thirdly, that the first non-existent is to
  the second as the circumference of a circle to its diameter. One great
  reason of the allowance of such unsound modes of expression is the
  confidence felt by the writers that &radic;-1 and log(-1) will make their
  way, however inaccurately described. I heartily wish that the cyclometers
  had knowledge enough to attack the weak points of algebraical diction:
  they would soon work a beneficial change.<a name="NtA_689"

  Marie Forster.<a name="NtA_690" href="#Nt_690"><sup>[690]</sup></a>
  Brussels, 1836, 12mo.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Mr. Forster, an Englishman settled at Bruges, was an observer in many
  subjects, but especially in meteorology. He communicated to the
  Astronomical Society, in 1848, the information that, in the registers
  kept by his grandfather, his father, and himself, beginning in 1767, new
  moon on Saturday was followed, nineteen times out of twenty, by twenty
  days of rain and wind. This statement being published in the
  <i>Athenæum</i>, a cluster of correspondents averred that the belief is
  common among seamen, in all parts of the world, and among landsmen too.
  Some one quoted a distich:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Saturday's moon and Sunday's full</p>
      <p>Never were fine and never <i>wull</i>."</p>

  <p>Another brought forward:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"If a Saturday's moon</p>
      <p>Comes once in seven years it comes too soon."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Mr. Forster did not say he was aware of the proverbial character of
  the phenomenon. He was a very eccentric man. He treated his dogs as
  friends, and buried them with ceremony. He quarrelled with the
  <i>curé</i> of his parish, who remarked that he could not take his dogs
  to heaven with him. I will go nowhere, said he, where I cannot take my
  dog. He was a sincere Catholic: but there is a point beyond which even
  churches have no influence.</p>

  <p>The following is some account of the announcement of 1849. The
  <i>Athenæum</i> (Feb. 17), giving an account of the meeting of the
  Astronomical Society in December, 1858, says:</p>

  <p>"Dr. Forster of Bruges, who is well known as a meteorologist, made a
  communication at which our readers will stare: he declares that by
  journals of the weather kept by his grandfather, father, and himself,
  ever since 1767, to the present time, <i>whenever the new moon has fallen
  on a Saturday, the following twenty days have been wet and windy</i>, in
  nineteen cases out of twenty. In spite of our friend Zadkiel<a
  name="NtA_691" href="#Nt_691"><sup>[691]</sup></a> and the others who
  declare that we would smother every truth that does not happen to agree
  with us, we are glad to see that the Society had the sense to publish
  this communication, coming, as it does, from a veteran observer, and one
  whose love of truth is undoubted. It must be that the fact is so set down
  in the journals, because Dr. Forster says it: and whether it be only a
  fact of the journals, or one of the heavens, can soon be tried. The new
  moon of March next, falls on <i>Saturday</i> the 24th, at 2 in the
  afternoon. We shall certainly look out."</p>

<p><!-- Page 322 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page322"></a>[322]</span></p>

  <p>The following appeared in the number of March 31:</p>

  <p>"The first <i>Saturday Moon</i> since Dr. Forster's announcement came
  off a week ago. We had previously received a number of letters from
  different correspondents&mdash;all to the effect that the notion of new
  moon on Saturday bringing wet weather is one of widely extended currency.
  One correspondent (who gives his name) states that he has constantly
  heard it at sea, and among the farmers and peasantry in Scotland,
  Ireland, and the North of England. He proceeds thus: 'Since 1826,
  nineteen years of the time I have spent in a seafaring life. I have
  constantly observed, though unable to account for, the phenomenon. I have
  also heard the stormy qualities of a Saturday's moon remarked by
  American, French, and Spanish seamen; and, still more distant, a Chinese
  pilot, who was once doing duty on board my vessel seemed to be perfectly
  cognizant of the fact.' So that it seems we have, in giving currency to
  what we only knew as a very curious communication from an earnest
  meteorologist, been repeating what is common enough among sailors and
  farmers. Another correspondent affirms that the thing is most devoutly
  believed in by seamen; who would as soon sail on a Friday as be in the
  Channel after a Saturday moon.&mdash;After a tolerable course of dry
  weather, there was some snow, accompanied by wind on Saturday last, here
  in London; there were also heavy louring clouds. Sunday was cloudy and
  cold, with a little rain; Monday was louring, Tuesday unsettled;
  Wednesday quite overclouded, with rain in the morning. The present
  occasion shows only a general change of weather with a tendency towards
  rain. If Dr. Forster's theory be true, it is decidedly one of the minor
  instances, as far as London weather is concerned.&mdash;It will take a
  good deal of evidence to make us believe in the omen of a Saturday Moon.
  But, as we have said of the Poughkeepsie Seer, the thing is very curious
  whether true or false. Whence comes this universal proverb&mdash;and a
  hundred others&mdash;while the meteorological observer <!-- Page 323
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page323"></a>[323]</span>cannot, when
  he puts down a long series of results, detect any weather cycles at all?
  One of our correspondents wrote us something of a lecture for
  encouraging, he said, the notion that <i>names</i> could influence the
  weather. He mistakes the question. If there be any weather cycles
  depending on the moon, it is possible that one of them may be so related
  to the week cycle of seven days, as to show recurrences which are of the
  kind stated, or any other. For example, we know that if the new moon of
  March fall on a Saturday in this year, it will most probably fall on a
  Saturday nineteen years hence. This is not connected with the spelling of
  Saturday&mdash;but with the connection between the motions of the sun and
  moon. Nothing but the Moon can settle the question&mdash;and we are
  willing to wait on her for further information. If the adage be true,
  then the philosopher has missed what lies before his eyes; if false, then
  the world can be led by the nose in spite of the eyes. Both these things
  happen sometimes; and we are willing to take whichever of the two
  solutions is borne out by future facts. In the mean time, we announce the
  next Saturday Moon for the 18th of August."</p>

  <p>How many coincidences are required to establish a law of connection?
  It depends on the way in which the mind views the matter in question.
  Many of the paradoxers are quite set up by a very few instances. I will
  now tell a story about myself, and then ask them a question.</p>

  <p>So far as instances can prove a law, the following is proved: no
  failure has occurred. Let a clergyman be known to me, whether by personal
  acquaintance or correspondence, or by being frequently brought before me
  by those with whom I am connected in private life: that clergyman does
  not, except in few cases, become a bishop; but <i>if</i> he become a
  bishop, he is sure, first or last, to become an arch-bishop. This has
  happened in every case. As follows:</p>

  <p>1. My last schoolmaster, a former Fellow of Oriel, was <!-- Page 324
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page324"></a>[324]</span>a very
  intimate college friend of Richard Whately<a name="NtA_692"
  href="#Nt_692"><sup>[692]</sup></a>, a younger man. Struck by his
  friend's talents, he used to talk of him perpetually, and predict his
  future eminence. Before I was sixteen, and before Whately had even given
  his Bampton Lectures, I was very familiar with his name, and some of his
  sayings. I need not say that he became Archbishop of Dublin.</p>

  <p>2. When I was a child, a first cousin of John Bird Sumner<a
  name="NtA_693" href="#Nt_693"><sup>[693]</sup></a> married a sister of my
  mother. I cannot remember the time when I first heard his name, but it
  was made very familiar to me. In time he became Bishop of Chester, and
  then, Archbishop of Canterbury. My reader may say that Dr. C.&nbsp;R.
  Sumner,<a name="NtA_694" href="#Nt_694"><sup>[694]</sup></a> Bishop of
  Winchester, has just as good a claim: but it is not so: those connected
  with me had more knowledge of Dr. J.&nbsp;B. Sumner;<a name="NtA_695"
  href="#Nt_695"><sup>[695]</sup></a> and said nothing, or next to nothing,
  of the other. Rumor says that the Bishop of Winchester has
  <i>declined</i> an Archbishopric: if so, my rule is a rule of
  gradations.</p>

  <p>3. Thomas Musgrave,<a name="NtA_696"
  href="#Nt_696"><sup>[696]</sup></a> Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge,
  was <i>Dean</i> of the college when I was an undergraduate: this brought
  me into connection with him, he giving impositions for not going to
  chapel, I writing them out according. We had also friendly intercourse in
  after life; I forgiving, he probably forgetting. Honest Tom <!-- Page 325
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page325"></a>[325]</span>Musgrave, as
  he used to be called, became Bishop of Hereford, and Archbishop of
  York.</p>

  <p>4. About the time when I went to Cambridge, I heard a great deal about
  Mr. C.&nbsp;T. Longley,<a name="NtA_697" href="#Nt_697"><sup>[697]</sup></a>
  of Christchurch, from a cousin of my own of the same college, long since
  deceased, who spoke of him much, and most affectionately. Dr. Longley
  passed from Durham to York, and thence to Canterbury. I cannot quite make
  out the two Archbishoprics; I do not remember any other private channel
  through which the name came to me: perhaps Dr. Longley, having two
  strings to his bow, would have been one archbishop if I had never heard
  of him.</p>

  <p>5. When Dr. Wm. Thomson<a name="NtA_698"
  href="#Nt_698"><sup>[698]</sup></a> was appointed to the see of
  Gloucester in 1861, he and I had been correspondents on the subject of
  logic&mdash;on which we had both written&mdash;for about fourteen years.
  On his elevation I wrote to him, giving the preceding instances, and
  informing him that he would certainly be an Archbishop. The case was a
  strong one, and the law acted rapidly; for Dr. Thomson's elevation to the
  see of York took place in 1862.</p>

  <p>Here are five cases; and there is no opposing instance. I have
  searched the almanacs since 1828, and can find no instance of a Bishop
  not finally Archbishop of whom I had known through private sources,
  direct or indirect. Now what do my paradoxers say? Is this a
  pre-established harmony, or a chain of coincidences? And how many
  instances will it require to establish a law?<a name="NtA_699"

  device to raise the wind. Secondly, that he was a protégé of Laplace, and
  of the Polignac party, and also an outspoken man. That after the
  revolution he was so obnoxious to the republican party that he judged it
  prudent to quit France; which he did in debt, leaving money for his
  creditors, but not enough, with M. Bouvard. In America he connected
  himself with an assurance office. <!-- Page 327 --><span

  written, and sent to France, chiefly with the intention of entrapping M.
  Arago, Nicollet's especial foe, into the belief of it. And those who
  narrate this version of the story wind up by saying that M. Arago
  <i>was</i> entrapped, and circulated the wonders through Paris, until a
  letter from Nicollet to M. Bouvard<a name="NtA_702"

  <p>By M. N. S. is meant <i>member of no society.</i>. This almanac bears
  on the title-page two recommendations. The <i>Morning Post</i> calls it
  one of the most important-if-true publications of our generation. The
  <i>Times</i> says: "If the basis of his theory prove sound, and its
  principles be sanctioned by a more extended experience, it is not too
  much to say that the importance of the discovery is equal to that of the
  longitude." Cautious journalist! Three times that of the longitude would
  have been too little to say. That the landsman might predict the weather
  of all the year, at its beginning, Jack would cheerfully give up
  astronomical longitude&mdash;<i>the</i> problem&mdash;altogether, and
  fall back on chronometers with the older Ls, lead, latitude, and
  look-out, applied to dead-reckoning. Mr. Murphy attempted to give the
  weather day by day: thus the first seven days of March <!-- Page 328
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page328"></a>[328]</span>bore
  Changeable; Rain; Rain; Rain-<i>wind</i>; Changeable; Fair; Changeable.
  To aim at such precision as to put a fair day between two changeable ones
  by weather theory was going very near the wind and weather too. Murphy
  opened the year with cold and frost; and the weather did the same. But
  Murphy, opposite to Saturday, January 20, put down "Fair, Probable lowest
  degree of winter temperature." When this Saturday came, it was not merely
  the probably coldest of 1838, but certainly the coldest of many
  consecutive years. Without knowing anything of Murphy, I felt it prudent
  to cover my nose with my glove as I walked the street at eight in the
  morning. The fortune of the Almanac was made. Nobody waited to see
  whether the future would dement the prophecy: the shop was beset in a
  manner which brought the police to keep order; and it was said that the
  Almanac for 1838 was a gain of 5,000<i>l.</i> to the owners. It very soon
  appeared that this was only a lucky hit: the weather-prophet had a
  modified reputation for a few years; and is now no more heard of. A work

</blockquote>

  <p>Logic, though the other exact science, has not had the sort of
  assailants who have clustered about mathematics. There is a sect which
  disputes the utility of logic, but there are no special points, like the
  quadrature of the circle, which <!-- Page 331 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page331"></a>[331]</span>excite dispute among those who admit other
  things. The old story about Aristotle having one logic to trammel us, and
  Bacon another to set us free,&mdash;always laughed at by those who really
  knew either Aristotle or Bacon,&mdash;now begins to be understood by a
  large section of the educated world. The author of this tract connects
  the old logic with the indecencies of the classical writers, and the new
  with moral purity: he appeals to women, who, "when they see plainly the
  demoralizing tendency of syllogistic logic, they will no doubt exert
  their powerful influence against it, and support the Baconian method."
  This is the only work against logic which I can introduce, but it is a
  rare one, I mean in contents. I quote the author's idea of a
  syllogism:</p>

  <p>"The basis of this system is the syllogism. This is a form of couching
  the substance of your argument or investigation into one short line or
  sentence&mdash;then corroborating or supporting it in another, and
  drawing your conclusion or proof in a third."</p>

  <p>On this definition he gives an example, as follows: "Every sin
  deserves death," the substance of the "argument or investigation." Then
  comes, "Every unlawful wish is a sin," which "corroborates or supports"
  the preceding: and, lastly, "therefore every unlawful wish deserves
  death," which is the "conclusion or proof." We learn, also, that
  "sometimes the first is called the premises (<i>sic</i>), and sometimes
  the first premiss"; as also that "the first is sometimes called the
  proposition, or subject, or affirmative, and the next the predicate, and
  sometimes the middle term." To which is added, with a mark of exclamation
  at the end, "but in analyzing the syllogism, there is a middle term, and
  a predicate too, in each of the lines!" It is clear that Aristotle never
  enslaved this mind.</p>

  <p>I have said that logic has no paradoxers, but I was speaking of old
  time. This science has slept until our own day: Hamilton<a name="NtA_707"

  name="page332"></a>[332]</span>the <i>general</i> development of the
  syllogism since the time of Aristotle; and in regard to the few
  <i>partial</i> improvements, the professed historians seem altogether
  ignorant." But in our time, the paradoxer, the opponent of common
  opinion, has appeared in this field. I do not refer to Prof. Boole,<a
  name="NtA_708" href="#Nt_708"><sup>[708]</sup></a> who is not a
  <i>paradoxer</i>, but a <i>discoverer</i>: his system could neither
  oppose nor support common opinion, for its grounds were not in the
  conception of any one. I speak especially of two others, who fought like
  cat and dog: one was dogmatical, the other categorical. The first was
  Hamilton himself&mdash;Sir William Hamilton of Edinburgh, the
  metaphysician, not Sir William <i>Rowan</i> Hamilton<a name="NtA_709"
  href="#Nt_709"><sup>[709]</sup></a> of Dublin, the mathematician, a
  combination of peculiar genius with unprecedented learning, erudite in
  all he could want except mathematics, for which he had no turn, and in
  which he had not even a schoolboy's knowledge, thanks to the Oxford of
  his younger day. The other was the author of this work, so fully
  described in Hamilton's writings that there is no occasion to describe
  him here. I shall try to say a few words in common language about the
  paradoxers.</p>

  <p>Hamilton's great paradox was the <i>quantification of the
  predicate</i>; a fearful phrase, easily explained. We all know that when
  we say "Men are animals," a form wholly unquantified in phrase, we speak
  of <i>all</i> men, but not of all animals: it is <i>some or all</i>, some
  may be all for aught the proposition says. This
  some-may-be-all-for-aught-we-say, or <i>not-none,</i> is the logician's
  <i>some</i>. One would suppose <!-- Page 333 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page333"></a>[333]</span>that "all men are some animals," would
  have been the logical phrase in all time: but the predicate never was
  quantified. The few who alluded to the possibility of such a thing found
  reasons for not adopting it over and above the great reason, that
  Aristotle did not adopt it. For Aristotle never ruled in physics or
  metaphysics <i>in the old time</i> with near so much of absolute sway as
  he has ruled in logic <i>down to our own time</i>. The logicians knew
  that in the proposition "all men are animals" the "animal" is not
  <i>universal</i>, but <i>particular</i> yet no one dared to say that
  <i>all</i> men are <i>some</i> animals, and to invent the phrase,
  "<i>some</i> animals are <i>all</i> men" until Hamilton leaped the ditch,
  and not only completed a system of enunciation, but applied it to
  syllogism.</p>

  <p>My own case is as peculiar as his: I have proposed to introduce
  mathematical <i>thought</i> into logic to an extent which makes the old
  stagers cry:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"St. Aristotle! what wild notions!</p>
      <p>Serve a <i>ne exeat regno</i><a name="NtA_710" href="#Nt_710"><sup>[710]</sup></a> on him!"</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Hard upon twenty years ago, a friend and opponent who stands high in
  these matters, and who is not nearly such a sectary of Aristotle and
  establishment as most, wrote to me as follows: "It is said that next to
  the man who forms the taste of the nation, the greatest genius is the man
  who corrupts it. I mean therefore no disrespect, but very much the
  reverse, when I say that I have hitherto always considered you as a great
  logical heresiarch." Coleridge says he thinks that it was Sir Joshua
  Reynolds who made the remark: which, to copy a bull I once heard, I
  cannot deny, because I was not there when he said it. My friend did not
  call me to repentance and reconciliation with the church: I think he had
  a guess that I was a reprobate sinner. My offences at that time were but
  small: I went on spinning syllogism systems, all alien from the common
  logic, until I had six, the initial letters of which, put together, from
  the <!-- Page 334 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page334"></a>[334]</span>names I gave before I saw what they would
  make, bar all repentance by the words</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>RUE NOT!</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>leaving to the followers of the old school the comfortable option of
  placing the letters thus:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>TRUE? NO!</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>It should however be stated that the question is not about absolute
  truth or falsehood. No one denies that anything I call an inference is an
  inference: they say that my alterations are <i>extra-logical</i>; that
  they are <i>material</i>, not <i>formal</i>; and that logic is a
  <i>formal</i> science.</p>

  <p>The distinction between material and formal is easily made, where the
  usual perversions are not required. A <i>form</i> is an empty machine,
  such as "Every X is Y"; it may be supplied with <i>matter</i>, as in
  "Every <i>man</i> is <i>animal</i>." The logicians will not see that
  their <i>formal</i> proposition, "Every X is Y," is material in three
  points, the degree of assertion, the quantity of the proposition, and the
  copula. The purely formal proposition is "There is the probability <span
  class="grk">&alpha;</span> that X stands in the relation L to Y." The
  time will come when it will be regretted that logic went without
  paradoxers for two thousand years: and when much that has been said on
  the distinction of form and matter will breed jokes.</p>

  <p>I give one instance of one mood of each of the systems, in the order
  of the letters first written above.</p>

  <p><i>Relative.</i>&mdash;In this system the formal relation is taken,
  that is, the copula may be any whatever. As a material instance, in which
  the <i>relations</i> are those of consanguinity (of men understood), take
  the following: X is the brother of Y; X is not the uncle of Z; therefore,
  Z is not the child of Y. The discussion of relation, and of the
  objections to the extension, is in the <i>Cambridge Transactions</i>,
  Vol. X, Part 2; a crabbed conglomerate.</p>

  <p><i>Undecided.</i>&mdash;In this system one premise, and want of power
  over another, infer want of power over a conclusion. <!-- Page 335
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page335"></a>[335]</span>As "Some men
  are not capable of tracing consequences; we cannot be sure that there are
  beings responsible for consequences who are incapable of tracing
  consequences; therefore, we cannot be sure that all men are responsible
  for the consequences of their actions."</p>

  <p><i>Exemplar.</i>&mdash;This, long after it suggested itself to me as a
  means of correcting a defect in Hamilton's system, I saw to be the very
  system of Aristotle himself, though his followers have drifted into
  another. It makes its subject and predicate examples, thus: Any one man
  is an animal; any one animal is a mortal; therefore, any one man is a
  mortal.</p>

  <p><i>Numerical.</i>&mdash;Suppose 100 Ys to exist: then if 70 Xs be Ys,
  and 40 Zs be Ys, it follows that 10 Xs (at least) are Zs. Hamilton, whose
  mind could not generalize on symbols, saw that the word <i>most</i> would
  come under this system, and admitted, as valid, such a syllogism as "most
  Ys are Xs; most Ys are Zs; therefore, some Xs are Zs."</p>

  <p><i>Onymatic.</i>&mdash;This is the ordinary system much enlarged in
  propositional forms. It is fully discussed in my <i>Syllabus of
  Logic</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Transposed.</i>&mdash;In this syllogism the quantity in one premise
  is transposed into the other. As, some Xs are not Ys; for every X there
  is a Y which is Z; therefore, some Zs are not Xs.</p>

  <p>Sir William Hamilton of Edinburgh was one of the best friends and
  allies I ever had. When I first began to publish speculation on this
  subject, he introduced me to the logical world as having plagiarized from
  him. This drew their attention: a mathematician might have written about
  logic under forms which had something of mathematical look long enough
  before the Aristotelians would have troubled themselves with him: as was
  done by John Bernoulli,<a name="NtA_711"
  href="#Nt_711"><sup>[711]</sup></a> <!-- Page 336 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page336"></a>[336]</span>James Bernoulli,<a
  name="NtA_712" href="#Nt_712"><sup>[712]</sup></a> Lambert,<a
  name="NtA_713" href="#Nt_713"><sup>[713]</sup></a> and Gergonne;<a
  name="NtA_714" href="#Nt_714"><sup>[714]</sup></a> who, when our
  discussion began, were not known even to omnilegent Hamilton. He
  retracted his accusation of <i>wilful</i> theft in a manly way when he
  found it untenable; but on this point he wavered a little, and was
  convinced to the last that I had taken his principle unconsciously. He
  thought I had done the same with Ploucquet<a name="NtA_715"
  href="#Nt_715"><sup>[715]</sup></a> and Lambert. It was his pet notion
  that I did not understand the commonest principles of logic, that I did
  not always know the difference between the middle term of a syllogism and
  its conclusion. It went against his grain to imagine that a mathematician
  could be a logician. So long as he took me to be riding my own hobby, he
  laughed consumedly: but when he thought he could make out that I was
  mounted behind Ploucquet or Lambert, the current ran thus: "It would
  indeed have been little short of a miracle had he, ignorant even of the
  common principles of logic, been able of himself to rise to
  generalization so lofty and so accurate as are supposed in the peculiar
  doctrines of both the rival logicians, Lambert and Ploucquet&mdash;how
  useless soever these may in practice prove to be." All this has been
  sufficiently discussed elsewhere: "but, masters, remember that I am an
  ass."</p>

  <p>I know that I never saw Lambert's work until after all Hamilton
  supposed me to have taken was written: he himself, who read almost
  everything, knew nothing about it until after I did. I cannot prove what
  I say about my knowledge of Lambert: but the means of doing it may turn
  up. For, by the casual turning up of an old letter, I <i>have</i> <!--
  Page 337 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page337"></a>[337]</span>found
  the means of clearing myself as to Ploucquet. Hamilton assumed that
  (unconsciously) I took from Ploucquet the notion of a logical notation in
  which the symbol of the conclusion is seen in the joint symbols of the
  premises. For example, in my own fashion I write down ( . ) ( . ), two
  symbols of premises. By these symbols I see that there is a valid
  conclusion, and that it may be written in symbol by striking out the two
  middle parentheses, which gives ( . . ) and reading the two negative dots
  as an affirmative. And so I see in ( . ) ( . ) that ( ) is the
  conclusion. This, in full, is the perception that "all are either Xs or
  Ys" and "all are either Ys or Zs" necessitates "some Xs are Zs." Now in
  Ploucquet's book of 1763, is found, "Deleatur in præmissis medius; id
  quod restat indicat conclusionem."<a name="NtA_716"
  href="#Nt_716"><sup>[716]</sup></a> In the paper in which I explain my
  symbols&mdash;which are altogether different from Ploucquet's&mdash;there
  is found "Erase the symbols of the middle term; the remaining symbols
  show the inference." There is very great likeness: and I would have
  excused Hamilton for his notion if he had fairly given reference to the
  part of the book in which his quotation was found. For I had shown in my
  <i>Formal Logic</i> what part of Ploucquet's book I had used: and a fair
  disputant would either have strengthened his point by showing that I had
  been at his part of the book, or allowed me the advantage of it being
  apparent that I had not given evidence of having seen that part of the
  book. My good friend, though an honest man, was sometimes unwilling to
  allow due advantage to controversial opponents.</p>

  <p>But to my point. The only work of Ploucquet I ever saw was lent me by
  my friend Dr. Logan,<a name="NtA_717" href="#Nt_717"><sup>[717]</sup></a>
  with whom I have often corresponded on logic, etc. I chanced (in 1865)
  <!-- Page 338 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page338"></a>[338]</span>to turn up the letter which he sent me
  (Sept. 12, 1847) <i>with the book</i>. Part of it runs thus: "I
  congratulate you on your success in your logical researches [that is, in
  asking for the book, I had described some results]. Since the reading of
  your first paper I have been satisfied as to the possibility of inventing
  a logical notation in which the rationale of the inference is contained
  in the symbol, though I never attempted to verify it [what I
  communicated, then, satisfied the writer that I had done and communicated
  what he, from my previous paper, suspected to be practicable]. I send you
  Ploucquet's dissertation....'</p>

  <p>It now being manifest that I cannot be souring grapes which have been
  taken from me, I will say what I never said in print before. There is not
  the slightest merit in making the symbols of the premises yield that of
  the conclusion by erasure: <i>the thing must do itself in every system
  which symbolises quantities</i>. For in every syllogism (except the
  inverted <i>Bramantip</i> of the Aristotelians) the conclusion is
  manifest in this way without symbols. This <i>Bramantip</i> destroys
  system in the Aristotelian lot: and circumstances which I have pointed
  out destroy it in Hamilton's own collection. But in that enlargement of
  the reputed Aristotelian system which I have called <i>onymatic</i>, and
  in that correction of Hamilton's system which I have called
  <i>exemplar</i>, the rule of erasure is universal, and may be seen
  without symbols.</p>

  <p>Our first controversy was in 1846. In 1847, in my <i>Formal Logic</i>,
  I gave him back a little satire for satire, just to show, as I stated,
  that I could employ ridicule if I pleased. He was so offended with the
  appendix in which this was contained, that he would not accept the copy
  of the book I sent him, but returned it. Copies of controversial works,
  sent from opponent to opponent, are not <i>presents</i>, in the usual
  sense: it was a marked success to make him angry enough to forget this.
  It had some effect however: during the rest of his life I wished to avoid
  provocation; for I <!-- Page 339 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page339"></a>[339]</span>could not feel sure that excitement might
  not produce consequences. I allowed his slashing account of me in the
  <i>Discussions</i> to pass unanswered: and before that, when he proposed
  to open a controversy in the <i>Athenæum</i> upon my second Cambridge
  paper, I merely deferred the dispute until the next edition of my
  <i>Formal Logic</i>. I cannot expect the account in the
  <i>Discussions</i> to amuse an unconcerned reader as much as it amused
  myself: but for a cut-and-thrust, might-and-main, tooth-and-nail,
  hammer-and-tongs assault, I can particularly recommend it. I never knew,
  until I read it, how much I should enjoy a thundering onslought on
  myself, done with racy insolence by a master hand, to whom my good genius
  had whispered <i>Ita feri ut se sentiat emori</i>.<a name="NtA_718"
  href="#Nt_718"><sup>[718]</sup></a> Since that time I have, as the
  Irishman said, become "dry moulded for want of a bating." Some of my
  paradoxers have done their best: but theirs is mere twopenny&mdash;"small
  swipes," as Peter Peebles said. Brandy for heroes! I hope a reviewer or
  two will have mercy on me, and will give me as good discipline as
  Strafford would have given Hampden and his set: "much beholden," said he,
  "should they be to any one that should thoroughly take pains with them in
  that kind"&mdash;meaning <i>objective</i> flagellation. And I shall be
  the same to any one who will serve me so&mdash;but in a literary and
  periodical sense: my corporeal cuticle is as thin as my neighbors'.</p>

  <p>Sir W. H. was suffering under local paralysis before our controversy
  commenced: and though his mind was quite unaffected, a retort of as
  downright a character as the attack might have produced serious effect
  upon a person who had shown himself sensible of ridicule. Had a second
  attack of his disorder followed an answer from me, I should have been
  held to have caused it: though, looking at Hamilton's genial love of
  combat, I strongly suspected that a retort in kind</p>

<p><!-- Page 340 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page340"></a>[340]</span></p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Would cheer his heart, and warm his blood,</p>
      <p>And make him fight, and do him good."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>But I could not venture to risk it. So all I did, in reply to the
  article in the <i>Discussions</i>, was to write to him the following
  note: which, as illustrating an etiquette of controversy, I insert.</p>

  <p>"I beg to acknowledge and thank you for.... It is necessary that I
  should say a word on my retention of this work, with reference to your
  return of the copy of my <i>Formal Logic</i>, which I presented to you on
  its publication: a return made on the ground of your disapproval of the
  account of our controversy which that work contained. According to my
  view of the subject, any one whose dealing with the author of a book is
  specially attacked in it, has a right to expect from the author that part
  of the book in which the attack is made, together with so much of the
  remaining part as is fairly context. And I hold that the acceptance by
  the party assailed of such work or part of a work does not imply any
  amount of approval of the contents, or of want of disapproval. On this
  principle (though I am not prepared to add the word <i>alone</i>) I
  forwarded to you the whole of my work on <i>Formal Logic</i> and my
  second Cambridge Memoir. And on this principle I should have held you
  wanting in due regard to my literary rights if you had not forwarded to
  me your asterisked pages, with all else that was necessary to a full
  understanding of their scope and meaning, so far as the contents of the
  book would furnish it. For the remaining portion, which it would be a
  hundred pities to separate from the pages in which I am directly
  concerned, I am your debtor on another principle; and shall be glad to
  remain so if you will allow me to make a feint of balancing the account
  by the offer of two small works on subjects as little connected with our
  discussion as the <i>Epistolæ Obscurorum Virorum</i>, or the Lutheran
  dispute. I trust that by accepting my <i>Opuscula</i> you will enable me
  to avoid the <!-- Page 341 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page341"></a>[341]</span>use of the knife, and leave me to cut you
  up with the pen as occasion shall serve, I remain, etc. (April 21,
  1852)."</p>

  <p>I received polite thanks, but not a word about the body of the letter:
  my argument, I suppose, was admitted.</p>

  <p>This is the first edition of this celebrated work. Its form is a case
  of the theory: the book is an undeniable duodecimo, but the size of its
  paper gives it the look of not the smallest of octavos. Does not this
  illustrate the law of development, the gradation of families, the
  transference of species, and so on? If so, I claim the discovery of this
  esoteric testimony of the book to its own contents; I defy any one to
  point out the reviewer who has mentioned it. The work itself is <span
  class="correction" title="text reads `decribed'">described</span> by its
  author as "the first attempt to connect the natural sciences into a
  history of creation." The attempt was commenced, and has been carried on,
  both with marked talent, and will be continued. Great advantage will
  result: at the worst we are but in the alchemy of some new chemistry, or
  the astrology of some new astronomy. Perhaps it would be as well not to
  be too sure on the matter, until we have an antidote to possible
  consequences as exhibited under another theory, on which <!-- Page 345
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page345"></a>[345]</span>it is as
  reasonable to speculate as on that of the <i>Vestiges</i>. I met long ago
  with a splendid player on the guitar, who assured me, and was confirmed
  by his friends, that he <i>never practised</i>, except in thought, and
  did not possess an instrument: he kept his fingers acting in his mind,
  until they got their habits; and thus he learnt the most difficult
  novelties of execution. Now what if this should be a minor segment of a
  higher law? What if, by constantly thinking of ourselves as descended
  from primeval monkeys, we should&mdash;if it be true&mdash;actually
  <i>get our tails again</i>? What if the first man who was detected with
  such an appendage should be obliged to confess himself the author of the
  <i>Vestiges</i>&mdash;a person yet unknown&mdash;who would naturally get
  the start of his species by having had the earliest habit of thinking on
  the matter? I confess I never hear a man of note talk fluently about it
  without a curious glance at his proportions, to see whether there may be
  ground to conjecture that he may have more of "mortal coil" than others,
  in anaxyridical concealment. I do not feel sure that even a paternal love
  for his theory would induce him, in the case I am supposing, to exhibit
  himself at the British Association,</p>

  <p>The Wesleyan minister addressed had advocated provision against old
  age, etc.: the writer declares all <i>private</i> provision un-Christian.
  After decent maintenance and relief of family claims of indigence, he
  holds that all the rest is to go to the "Benefit Society," of which he
  draws up the rules, in technical form, with chapters of "Officers,"
  "Contributors" etc., from the Acts of the Apostles, etc., and some of the
  early Fathers. He holds that a Christian may not "make a <i>private</i>
  provision against the contingencies of the future": and that the great
  "Benefit Society" is the divinely-ordained recipient of all the surplus
  of his income; capital, beyond what is necessary for business, he is to
  have none. A real good speculator shuts his eyes by instinct, when
  opening them would not serve the purpose: he has the vizor of the Irish
  fairy tale, which fell of itself over the eyes of the wearer the moment
  he turned them upon the enchanted light which would have destroyed him if
  he had caught sight of it. "Whiles it remained, was it not thine own? and
  after it was sold, was it (the purchase-money) not in thine own power?"
  would have been awkward to quote, and accordingly nothing is stated
  except the well-known result, which is rule 3, cap. 5, "Prevention of
  Abuses." By putting his principles together, the author can be made,
  logically, to mean that the successors of the apostles should put to
  death all contributors who are detected in not paying their full
  premiums.</p>

<p><!-- Page 347 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page347"></a>[347]</span></p>

  <p>I have known one or two cases in which policy-holders have surrendered
  their policies through having arrived at a conviction that direct
  provision is unlawful. So far as I could make it out, these parties did
  not think it unlawful to lay by out of income, except when this was done
  in a manner which involved calculation of death-chances. It is singular
  they did not see that the entrance of chance of death was the entrance of
  the very principle of the benefit society described in the Acts of the
  Apostles. The family of the one who died young received more in
  proportion to <i>premiums</i> paid than the family of one who died old.
  Every one who understands life assurance sees that&mdash;<i>bonus</i>
  apart&mdash;the difference between an assurance office and a savings bank
  consists in the adoption, <i>pro tanto</i>, of the principle of community
  of goods. In the original constitution of the oldest assurance office,
  the <i>Amicable Society</i>, the plan with which they started was nothing
  but this: persons of all ages under forty-five paid one common premium,
  and the proceeds were divided among the representatives of those who died
  within the year.</p>

<p class="cenhead">EASTER DAY PARADOXERS.</p>

  <p>In the years 1818 and 1845 the full moon fell on Easter Day, having
  been particularly directed to fall before it in the act for the change of
  style and in the English missals and prayer-books of all time: perhaps it
  would be more correct to say that Easter Day was directed to fall after
  the full moon; "but the principle is the same." No explanation was given
  in 1818, but Easter was kept by the tables, <!-- Page 354 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page354"></a>[354]</span>in defiance of the
  rule, and of several protests. A chronological panic was beginning in
  December 1844, which was stopped by the <i>Times</i> newspaper printing
  extracts from an article of mine in the <i>Companion to the Almanac</i>
  for 1845, which had then just appeared. No one had guessed the true
  reason, which is that the thing called the moon in the Gregorian Calendar
  is not the moon of the heavens, but a fictitious imitation put wrong on
  purpose, as will presently appear, partly to keep Easter out of the way
  of the Jews' Passover, partly for convenience of calculation. The
  apparent error happens but rarely; and all the work will perhaps have to
  be gone over next time. I now give two bits of paradox.</p>

  <p>Some theologians were angry at this explanation. A review called the
  <i>Christian Observer</i> (of which Christianity I do not know) got up a
  crushing article against me. I did not look at it, feeling sure that an
  article on such a subject which appeared on January 1, 1845, against a
  publication made in December 1844, must be a second-hand job. But some
  years afterwards (Sept. 10, 1850), the reviews, etc. having been just
  placed at the disposal of readers in the <i>old</i> reading-room of the
  Museum, I made a tour of inspection, came upon my critic on his perch,
  and took a look at him. I was very glad to remember this, for, though
  expecting only second-hand, yet even of this there is good and bad; and I
  expected to find some hints in the good second-hand of a respectable
  clerical publication. I read on, therefore, attentively, but not long: I
  soon came to the information that some additions to Delambre's<a
  name="NtA_739" href="#Nt_739"><sup>[739]</sup></a> statement of the rule
  for finding Easter, belonging to distant years, had been made by Sir
  Harris Nicolas!<a name="NtA_740" href="#Nt_740"><sup>[740]</sup></a> Now
  as I myself furnished my friend Sir H.&nbsp;N. with Delambre's digest of <!--
  Page 355 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page355"></a>[355]</span>Clavius's<a name="NtA_741"
  href="#Nt_741"><sup>[741]</sup></a> rule, which I translated out of
  algebra into common language for the purpose, I was pretty sure this was
  the ignorant reading of a person to whom Sir H.&nbsp;N. was the highest
  <i>arithmetical</i> authority on the subject. A person pretending to
  chronology, without being able to distinguish the historical
  points&mdash;so clearly as they stand out&mdash;in which Sir H.&nbsp;N. speaks
  with authority, from the arithmetical points of pure reckoning on which
  he does not pretend to do more than directly repeat others, must be as
  fit to talk about the construction of Easter Tables as the Spanish are to
  talk French. I need hardly say that the additions for distant years are
  as much from Clavius as the rest: my reviewer was not deep enough in his
  subject to know that Clavius made and published, from his rules, the full
  table up to A.D. 5000, for all the movable feasts of every year! I gave
  only a glance at the rest: I found I was either knave or fool, with a
  leaning to the second opinion; and I came away satisfied that my critic
  was either ignoramus or novice, with a leaning to the first. I afterwards
  found an ambiguity of expression in Sir H.&nbsp;N.'s account&mdash;whether his
  or mine I could not tell&mdash;which might mislead a novice or content an
  ignoramus, but would have been properly read or further inquired into by
  a competent person.</p>

  <p>The second case is this. Shortly after the publication of my article,
  a gentleman called at my house, and, finding I was not at home, sent up
  his card&mdash;with a stylish west-end club on it&mdash;to my wife,
  begging for a few words on pressing business. With many well-expressed
  apologies, he stated that he had been alarmed by hearing that Prof. De M.
  had an intention of altering Easter next year. Mrs. De M. kept her
  countenance, and assured him that I had no such intention, and further,
  that she greatly doubted my having the power to do it. Was she quite
  sure? his authority was very good: fresh assurances given. He was greatly
  relieved, for he had some horses training for after Easter, which <!--
  Page 356 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page356"></a>[356]</span>would
  not be ready to run if it were altered the wrong way. A doubt comes over
  him: would Mrs. De M., in the event of her being mistaken, give him the
  very earliest information? Promise given; profusion of thanks; more
  apologies; and departure.</p>

  <p>Now, candid reader!&mdash;or uncandid either!&mdash;which most
  deserves to be laughed at? A public instructor, who undertakes to settle
  for the world whether a reader of Clavius, the constructor of the
  Gregorian Calendar, is fool or knave, upon information derived from a
  compiler&mdash;in this matter&mdash;of his own day; or a gentleman of
  horse and dog associations, who, misapprehending something which he heard
  about a current topic, infers that the reader of Clavius had the ear of
  the Government on a proposed alteration. I suppose the querist had heard
  some one say, perhaps, that the day ought to be set right, and some one
  else remark that I might be consulted, as the only person who had
  discussed the matter from the original source of the Calendar.</p>

  <p>To give a better chance of the explanation being at once produced,
  next time the real full moon and Easter Day shall fall together, I insert
  here a summary which was printed in the Irish Prayer-book of the
  Ecclesiastical Society. If the amusement given by paradoxers should
  prevent a useless discussion some years hence, I and the paradoxers shall
  have done a little good between us&mdash;at any rate, I have done my best
  to keep the heavy weight afloat by tying bladders to it. I think the next
  occurrence will be in 1875.</p>

<p class="cenhead"><span class="scac">EASTER DAY.</span></p>

  <p>In the years 1818 and 1845, Easter Day, as given by the <i>rules
  in</i> 24 Geo. II cap. 23. (known as the act for the <i>change of
  style</i>) contradicted the <i>precept</i> given in the preliminary
  explanations. The precept is as follows:</p>

  <p>"<i>Easter Day</i>, on which the rest" of the moveable feasts "depend,
  is always the First Sunday after the Full Moon, which happens upon or
  next after the Twenty-first Day of <!-- Page 357 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page357"></a>[357]</span><i>March</i>; and if
  the Full Moon happens upon a Sunday, <i>Easter Day</i> is the Sunday
  after."</p>

  <p>But in 1818 and 1845, the full moon fell on a Sunday, and yet the
  rules gave <i>that same Sunday</i> for Easter Day. Much discussion was
  produced by this circumstance in 1818: but a repetition of it in 1845 was
  nearly altogether prevented by a timely<a name="NtA_742"
  href="#Nt_742"><sup>[742]</sup></a> reference to the intention of those
  who conducted the Gregorian reformation of the Calendar. Nevertheless,
  seeing that the apparent error of the Calendar is due to the precept in
  the Act of Parliament, which is both erroneous and insufficient, and that
  the difficulty will recur so often as Easter Day falls on the day of full
  moon, it may be advisable to select from the two articles cited in the
  note such of their conclusions and rules, without proof or controversy,
  as will enable the reader to understand the main points of the Easter
  question, and, should he desire it, to calculate for himself the Easter
  of the old or new style, for any given year.</p>

  <p>1. In the very earliest age of Christianity, a controversy arose as to
  the mode of keeping Easter, some desiring to perpetuate the
  <i>Passover</i>, others to keep the <i>festival of the Resurrection</i>.
  The first afterwards obtained the name of <i>Quartadecimans</i>, from
  their Easter being always kept on the <i>fourteenth day</i> of the moon
  (Exod. xii. 18, Levit. xxiii. 5.). But though it is unquestionable that a
  Judaizing party existed, it is also likely that many dissented on
  chronological grounds. It is clear that no <i>perfect</i> anniversary can
  take place, except when the fourteenth of the moon, and with it the
  passover, falls on a Friday. Suppose, for instance, it falls on a
  Tuesday: one of three things must be <!-- Page 358 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page358"></a>[358]</span>done. Either (which
  seems never to have been proposed) the crucifixion and resurrection must
  be celebrated on Tuesday and Sunday, with a wrong interval; or the former
  on Tuesday, the latter on Thursday, abandoning the first day of the week;
  or the former on Friday, and the latter on Sunday, abandoning the paschal
  commemoration of the crucifixion.</p>

  <p>The last mode has been, as every one knows, finally adopted. The
  disputes of the first three centuries did not turn on any <i>calendar</i>
  questions. The Easter question was merely the symbol of the struggle
  between what we may call the Jewish and Gentile sects of Christians: and
  it nearly divided the Christian world, the Easterns, for the most part,
  being <i>Quartadecimans</i>. It is very important to note that there is
  no recorded dispute about a method of predicting the new moon, that is,
  no general dispute leading to formation of sects: there may have been
  difficulties, and discussions about them. The Metonic cycle, presently
  mentioned, must have been used by many, perhaps most, churches.</p>

  <p>2. The question came before the Nicene Council (A.D. 325) not as an
  astronomical, but as a doctrinal, question: it was, in fact, this, Shall
  the <i>passover</i><a name="NtA_743" href="#Nt_743"><sup>[743]</sup></a>
  be treated as a part of Christianity? The Council resolved this question
  in the negative, and the only information on its premises and conclusion,
  or either, which comes from itself, is contained in the following
  sentence of the synodical epistle, which epistle is preserved by
  Socrates<a name="NtA_744" href="#Nt_744"><sup>[744]</sup></a> and
  Theodoret.<a name="NtA_745" href="#Nt_745"><sup>[745]</sup></a> "We also
  send <!-- Page 359 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page359"></a>[359]</span>you the good news concerning the unanimous
  consent of all in reference to the celebration of the most solemn feast
  of Easter, for this difference also has been made up by the assistance of
  your prayers: so that all the brethren in the East, who formerly
  celebrated this festival <i>at the same time as the Jews</i>, will in
  future conform <i>to the Romans and to us</i>, and to all who have of old
  observed <i>our manner</i> of celebrating Easter." This is all that can
  be found on the subject: none of the stories about the Council ordaining
  the astronomical mode of finding Easter, and introducing the Metonic
  cycle into ecclesiastical reckoning, have any contemporary evidence: the
  canons which purport to be those of the Nicene Council do not contain a
  word about Easter; and this is evidence, whether we suppose those canons
  to be genuine or spurious.</p>

  <p>3. The astronomical dispute about a lunar cycle for the prediction of
  Easter either commenced, or became prominent, by the extinction of
  greater ones, soon after the time of the Nicene Council. Pope Innocent
  I<a name="NtA_746" href="#Nt_746"><sup>[746]</sup></a> met with
  difficulty in 414. S. Leo,<a name="NtA_747"
  href="#Nt_747"><sup>[747]</sup></a> in 454, ordained that Easter of 455
  should be April 24; which is right. It is useless to record details of
  these disputes in a summary: the result was, that in the year 463, Pope
  Hilarius<a name="NtA_748" href="#Nt_748"><sup>[748]</sup></a> employed
  Victorinus<a name="NtA_749" href="#Nt_749"><sup>[749]</sup></a> of
  Aquitaine to correct the Calendar, and Victorinus formed a rule which
  lasted until the sixteenth century. He combined the Metonic cycle and the
  solar cycle presently described. But <!-- Page 360 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page360"></a>[360]</span>this cycle bears the
  name of Dionysius Exiguus,<a name="NtA_750"
  href="#Nt_750"><sup>[750]</sup></a> a Scythian settled at Rome, about
  A.D. 530, who adapted it to his new yearly reckoning, when he abandoned
  the era of Diocletian as a commencement, and constructed that which is
  now in common use.</p>

  <p>4. With Dionysius, if not before, terminated all difference as to the
  mode of keeping Easter which is of historical note: the increasing
  defects of the Easter Cycle produced in time the remonstrance of persons
  versed in astronomy, among whom may be mentioned Roger Bacon,<a
  name="NtA_751" href="#Nt_751"><sup>[751]</sup></a> Sacrobosco,<a
  name="NtA_752" href="#Nt_752"><sup>[752]</sup></a> Cardinal Cusa,<a
  name="NtA_753" href="#Nt_753"><sup>[753]</sup></a> Regiomontanus,<a
  name="NtA_754" href="#Nt_754"><sup>[754]</sup></a> etc. From the middle
  of the sixth to that of the sixteenth century, one rule was observed.</p>

  <p>5. The mode of applying astronomy to chronology has always involved
  these two principles. First, the actual position of the heavenly body is
  not the object of consideration, but what astronomers call its <i>mean
  place</i>, which may be described thus. Let a fictitious sun or moon move
  in the heavens, in such manner as to revolve among the fixed stars at an
  average rate, avoiding the alternate accelerations and retardations which
  take place in every planetary motion. Thus the fictitious (say
  <i>mean</i>) sun and moon are always very near to the real sun and moon.
  The ordinary clocks show time by the mean, not the real, sun: and it was
  always laid down that Easter depends on the opposition (or full moon) of
  the mean sun and moon, not of the real ones. Thus we see that, were the
  Calendar ever so correct <!-- Page 361 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page361"></a>[361]</span>as to the <i>mean</i> moon, it would be
  occasionally false as to the <i>true</i> one: if, for instance, the
  opposition of the mean sun and moon took place at one second before
  midnight, and that of the real bodies only two seconds afterwards, the
  calendar day of full moon would be one day before that of the common
  almanacs. Here is a way in which the discussions of 1818 and 1845 might
  have arisen: the British legislature has defined <i>the moon</i> as the
  regulator of the paschal calendar. But this was only a part of the
  mistake.</p>

  <p>6. Secondly, in the absence of perfectly accurate knowledge of the
  solar and lunar motion (and for convenience, even if such knowledge
  existed), cycles are, and always have been taken, which serve to
  represent those motions nearly. The famous Metonic cycle, which is
  introduced into ecclesiastical chronology under the name of the cycle of
  the golden numbers, is a period of 19 Julian<a name="NtA_755"
  href="#Nt_755"><sup>[755]</sup></a> years. This period, in the old
  Calendar, was taken to contain exactly 235 <i>lunations</i>, or intervals
  between new moons, of the mean moon. Now the state of the case is:</p>

  <p>19 average Julian years make 6939 days 18 hours.</p>

  <p>235 average lunations make 6939 days 16 hours 31 minutes.</p>

  <p>So that successive cycles of golden numbers, supposing the first to
  start right, amount to making the new moons fall too late, gradually, so
  that the mean moon <i>of this cycle</i> gains 1 hour 29 minutes in 19
  years upon the mean moon of the heavens, or about a day in 300 years.
  When the Calendar was reformed, the calendar new moons were four days in
  advance of the mean moon of the heavens: so that, for instance, calendar
  full moon on the 18th usually meant real full moon on the 14th.</p>

  <p>7. If the difference above had not existed, the moon of the heavens
  (the mean moon at least), would have returned <!-- Page 362 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page362"></a>[362]</span>permanently to the same
  days of the month in 19 years; with an occasional slip arising from the
  unequal distribution of the leap years, of which a period contains
  sometimes five and sometimes four. As a general rule, the days of new and
  full moon in any one year would have been also the days of new and full
  moon of a year having 19 more units in its date. Again, if there had been
  no leap years, the days of the month would have returned to the same days
  of the week every seven years. The introduction of occasional 29ths of
  February disturbs this, and makes the permanent return of month days to
  week days occur only after 28 years. If all had been true, the lapse of
  28 times 19, or 532 years, would have restored the year in every point:
  that is, A.D. 1, for instance, and A.D. 533, would have had the same
  almanac in every matter relating to week days, month days, sun, and moon
  (mean sun and moon at least). And on the supposition of its truth, the
  old system of Dionysius was framed. Its errors, are, first, that the
  moments of mean new moon advance too much by 1 h. 29 m. in 19 average
  Julian years; secondly, that the average Julian year of 365¼ days is too
  long by 11 m. 10 s.</p>

  <p>8. The Council of Trent, moved by the representations made on the
  state of the Calendar, referred the consideration of it to the Pope. In
  1577, Gregory XIII<a name="NtA_756" href="#Nt_756"><sup>[756]</sup></a>
  submitted to the Roman Catholic Princes and Universities a plan presented
  to him by the representatives of Aloysius Lilius,<a name="NtA_757"
  href="#Nt_757"><sup>[757]</sup></a> then deceased. This plan being
  approved of, the Pope nominated a commission to consider its details, the
  working member of which was the Jesuit Clavius. A short work was prepared
  by Clavius, descriptive of the new Calendar: this <!-- Page 363 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page363"></a>[363]</span>was published<a
  name="NtA_758" href="#Nt_758"><sup>[758]</sup></a> in 1582, with the
  Pope's bull (dated February 24, 1581) prefixed. A larger work was
  prepared by Clavius, containing fuller explanation, and entitled
  <i>Romani Calendarii a Gregorio XIII. Pontifice Maximo restituti
  Explicatio</i>. This was published at Rome in 1603, and again in the
  collection of the works of Clavius in 1612.</p>

  <p>9. The following extracts from Clavius settle the question of the
  meaning of the term <i>moon</i>, as used in the Calendar:</p>

  <p>"Who, except a few who think they are very sharp-sighted in this
  matter, is so blind as not to see that the 14th of the moon and the full
  moon are not the same things in the Church of God?... Although the
  Church, in finding the new moon, and from it the 14th day, <i>uses
  neither the true nor the mean motion of the moon</i>, but measures only
  according to the order of a cycle, it is nevertheless undeniable that the
  mean full moons found from astronomical tables are of the greatest use in
  determining the cycle which is to be preferred ... the new moons of which
  cycle, in order to the due celebration of Easter, should be so arranged
  that the 14th days of those moons, reckoning from the day of new moon
  <i>inclusive</i>, should not fall two or more days before the mean full
  moon, but only one day, or else on the very day itself, or not long
  after. And even thus far the Church need not take very great pains ...
  for it is sufficient that all should reckon by the 14th day of the moon
  in the cycle, even though sometimes it <i>should be more than one day
  before or after</i> the mean full moon.... We have taken pains that in
  our cycle the new moons should <i>follow</i> the real new moons, so that
  the 14th of the moon should fall either the day before the mean full
  moon, or on that day, or not long after; and this was done on purpose,
  for if the new moon of the cycle fell on the same day as the mean new
  moon of the <!-- Page 364 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page364"></a>[364]</span>astronomers, it might chance that we
  should celebrate Easter on the same day as the Jews or the Quartadeciman
  heretics, which would be absurd, or else before them, which would be
  still more absurd."</p>

  <p>From this it appears that Clavius continued the Calendar of his
  predecessors in the choice of the <i>fourteenth</i> day of the moon. Our
  legislature lays down the day of the <i>full moon</i>: and this mistake
  appears to be rather English than Protestant; for it occurs in missals
  published in the reign of Queen Mary. The calendar lunation being 29½
  days, the middle day is the <i>fifteenth</i> day, and this is and was
  reckoned as the day of the full moon. There is every right to presume
  that the original passover was a feast of the <i>real full moon</i>: but
  it is most probable that the moons were then reckoned, not from the
  astronomical conjunction with the sun, which nobody sees except at an
  eclipse, but from the day of <i>first visibility</i> of the new moon. In
  fine climates this would be the day or two days after conjunction; and
  the fourteenth day from that of first visibility inclusive, would very
  often be the day of full moon. The following is then the proper
  correction of the precept in the Act of Parliament:</p>

  <p>Easter Day, on which the rest depend, is always the First Sunday after
  the <i>fourteenth day</i> of the <i>calendar</i> moon which happens upon
  or next after the Twenty-first day of March, <i>according to the rules
  laid down for the construction of the Calendar</i>; and if the
  <i>fourteenth day</i> happens upon a Sunday, Easter Day is the Sunday
  after.</p>

  <p>10. Further, it appears that Clavius valued the celebration of the
  festival after the Jews, etc., more than astronomical correctness. He
  gives comparison tables which would startle a believer in the
  astronomical intention of his Calendar: they are to show that a calendar
  in which the moon is always made a day older than by him, <i>represents
  the heavens better than he has done, or meant to do</i>. But it must be
  observed that this diminution of the real moon's age has <!-- Page 365
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page365"></a>[365]</span>a tendency to
  make the English explanation often practically accordant with the
  Calendar. For the fourteenth day of Clavius <i>is</i> generally the
  fifteenth day of the mean moon of the heavens, and therefore most often
  that of the real moon. But for this, 1818 and 1845 would not have been
  the only instances of our day in which the English precept would have
  contradicted the Calendar.</p>

  <p>11. In the construction of the Calendar, Clavius adopted the ancient
  cycle of 532 years, but, we may say, without ever allowing it to run out.
  At certain periods, a shift is made from one part of the cycle into
  another. This is done whenever what should be Julian leap year is made a
  common year, as in 1700, 1800, 1900, 2100, etc. It is also done at
  certain times to correct the error of 1 h. 19 m., before referred to, in
  each cycle of golden numbers: Clavius, to meet his view of the amount of
  that error, put forward the moon's age a day 8 times in 2,500 years. As
  we cannot enter at full length into the explanation, we must content
  ourselves with giving a set of rules, independent of tables, by which the
  reader may find Easter for himself in any year, either by the old
  Calendar or the new. Any one who has much occasion to find Easters and
  movable feasts should procure Franc&oelig;ur's<a name="NtA_759"
  href="#Nt_759"><sup>[759]</sup></a> tables.</p>

  (0).</p>

  <p>V. From the sum of I, II, and IV., subtract III. (2310).</p>

  <p>VI. Find the remainder of V. divided by 7. (0).</p>

  <p>IX. From the centurial figures of the year subtract 17, divide by 25,
  and keep the quotient. (0).</p>

  <p>X. Subtract IX. and 15 from the centurial figures, divide by 3, and
  keep the quotient. (1).</p>

  <p>XI. To VIII. add ten times the next less number, divide by 30, and

  in any year of the old style.</i> To the several parts of the rule are
  annexed, by way of example, the results for the year 1287. The steps are
  numbered to correspond with the steps of the Gregorian rule, so that it
  can be seen what augmentations the latter requires.</p>

  <p>I. Set down the given year. (1287).</p>

  <p>II. Take the quotient of the given year divided by 4, neglecting the
  remainder (321).</p>

  <p>V. Take 4 more than the sum of I. and II. (1612).</p>

  <p>VI. Find the remainder of V. divided by 7. (2).</p>

  <p>VII. Subtract VI. from 7; this is the number of the dominical
  letter</p>

<table class="nob" summary="Dominical letters" title="Dominical letters">
<tr><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>5</td><td>6</td><td>7</td><td valign="middle">(5; dominical letter E).</td></tr>
<tr><td>A</td><td>B</td><td>C</td><td>D</td><td>E</td><td>F</td><td>G</td></tr>
</table>

  <p>VIII. Divide one more than the given year by 19, the remainder (or 19
  if no remainder) is the golden number. (15).</p>

  <p>XII. Divide 3 less than 11 times VIII. by 30; the remainder (or 30 if
  there be no remainder) is the epact. (12).</p>

<table width="100%" summary="Epacts" title="Epacts"><tr><td valign="top" class="spac" style="width:50%">
<i>When the Epact is 23, or less.</i>

  <p>XIII. Subtract XII., the epact, from 45. (33).</p>

  <p>XIV. Subtract the epact from 27, divide by 7, and keep the remainder,
  or 7, if there be no remainder, (1).</p>

</td><td valign="top" class="spac" style="width:50%">
<i>When the Epact is greater than 23.</i>

  <p>XIII. Subtract XII., the epact, from 75.</p>

  <p>XIV. Subtract the epact from 57, divide by 7, and keep the remainder,
  or 7, if there be no remainder.</p>

</td></tr></table>

  <p>XV. To XIII. add VII., the dominical number, (and 7 besides if XIV. be
  greater than VII.,) and subtract XIV., the result is the day of March, or
  if more than 31, subtract 31, and the result is the day of April, on
  which Easter Sunday (old style) falls. (37; Easter Day is April 6).</p>

  <p>These rules completely represent the old and new Calendars, so far as
  Easter is concerned. For further explanation we must refer to the
  articles cited at the commencement.</p>

  <p>The annexed is the table of new and full moons of the Gregorian
  Calendar, cleared of the errors made for the purpose of preventing Easter
  from coinciding with the Jewish Passover.</p>

  <p>The second table (page <a href="#page370">370</a>) contains
  <i>epacts</i>, or ages of the moon at the beginning of the year: thus in
  1913, the epact is 22, in 1868 it is 6. This table goes from 1850 to
  1999: should the New Zealander not have arrived by that time, and should
  the churches of England and Rome then survive, the epact table may be
  continued from their liturgy-books. The way of using the table is as
  follows: Take the epact of the required year, and find it in the first or
  last column of the first table, in line with it are seen the calendar
  days of new and full moon. Thus, when the epact is 17, the new and full
  moons of March fall on the 13th and 28th. The result is, for the most
  part, correct: but in a minority of cases there is an error of a day.
  When this happens, the error is almost always a fraction of a day much
  less than twelve hours. Thus, when the table gives full moon on the 27th,
  and the real truth is the 28th, we may be sure it is early on the
  28th.</p>

  <p>When the truth is the day after + is written after the date; when the
  day before, -. Thus, the new moon of March is on the 6th; the full moon
  of April is on the 18th. <!-- Page 371 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page371"></a>[371]</span></p>

  <p>I now introduce a small paradox of my own; and as I am not able to
  prove it, I am compelled to declare that any one who shall dissent must
  be either very foolish or very dishonest, and will make me quite
  uncomfortable about the state of his soul. This being settled once for
  all, I proceed to say that the necessity of arriving at the truth about
  the assertions that the Nicene Council laid down astronomical tests led
  me to look at Fathers, Church histories, etc. to an extent which I never
  dreamed of before. One conclusion which I arrived at was, that the Nicene
  Fathers had a knack of sticking to the question which many later councils
  could not acquire. In our own day, it is not permitted to Convocation
  seriously to discuss any one of the points which are bearing so hard upon
  their resources of defence&mdash;the cursing clauses of the Athanasian
  Creed, for example. And it may be collected that the prohibition arises
  partly from fear that there is no saying where a beginning, if allowed,
  would end. There seems to be a suspicion that debate, once let loose,
  would play up old Trent with the liturgy, and bring the whole book to
  book. But if any one will examine the real Nicene Creed, without the
  augmentation, he will admire the way in which the framers stuck to the
  point, and settled what they had to decide, according to their view of
  it. With such a presumption of good sense in their favor, it becomes
  easier to believe in any claim which may be made on their behalf to tact
  or sagacity in settling any other matter. And I strongly suspect such a
  claim may be made for them on the Easter question.</p>

  <p>I collect from many little indications, both before and after the
  Council, that the division of the Christian world into Judaical and
  Gentile, though not giving rise to a sectarian distinction expressed by
  names, was of far greater force and meaning than historians prominently
  admit. I took <i>note</i> of many indications of this, but not
  <i>notes</i>, as it was not to my purpose. If it were so, we must admire
  the discretion of the Council. The Easter question was the <!-- Page 372
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page372"></a>[372]</span>fighting
  ground of the struggle: the Eastern or Judaical Christians, with some
  varieties of usage and meaning, would have the Passover itself to be the
  great feast, but taken in a Christian sense; the Western or Gentile
  Christians, would have the commemoration of the Resurrection, connected
  with the Passover only by chronology. To shift the Passover in time,
  under its name, <i>Pascha</i>, without allusion to any of the force of
  the change, was gently cutting away the ground from under the feet of the
  Conservatives. And it was done in a very quiet way: no allusion to the
  precise character of the change; no hint that the question was about two
  different festivals: "all the brethren in the East, who formerly
  celebrated this festival at the same time as the Jews, will in future
  conform to the Romans and to us." The Judaizers meant to be keeping the
  Passover <i>as</i> a Christian feast: they are gently assumed to be
  keeping, <i>not</i> the Passover, <i>but</i> a Christian feast; and a
  doctrinal decision is quietly, but efficiently, announced under the form
  of a chronological ordinance. Had the Council issued theses of doctrine,
  and excommunicated all dissentients, the rupture of the East and West
  would have taken place earlier by centuries than it did. The only place
  in which I ever saw any part of my paradox advanced, was in an article in
  the <i>Examiner</i> newspaper, towards the end of 1866, after the above
  was written.</p>

  <p>A story about Christopher Clavius, the workman of the new Calendar. I
  chanced to pick up "Albertus Pighius Campensis de æquinoctiorum
  solsticiorumque inventione... Ejusdem de ratione Paschalis celebrationis,
  De que Restitutione ecclesiastici Kalendarii," Paris, 1520, folio.<a
  name="NtA_760" href="#Nt_760"><sup>[760]</sup></a> On the title-page were
  decayed words followed by "..<i>hristophor.. C..ii</i>, 1556 (or 8)," the
  last blank not entirely erased by time, but showing the lower halves of
  an <i>l</i> and of an <i>a</i>, and <!-- Page 373 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page373"></a>[373]</span>rather too much room
  for a <i>v</i>. It looked very like <i>E Libris Christophori Clavii</i>
  1556. By the courtesy of some members of the Jesuit body in London, I
  procured a tracing of the signature of Clavius from Rome, and the shapes
  of the letters, and the modes of junction and disjunction, put the matter
  beyond question. Even the extra space was explained; he wrote himself
  Cla<i>u</i>ius. Now in 1556, Clavius was nineteen years old: it thus
  appears probable that the framer of the Gregorian Calendar was selected,
  not merely as a learned astronomer, but as one who had attended to the
  calendar, and to works on its reformation, from early youth. When on the
  subject I found reason to think that Clavius had really read this work,
  and taken from it a phrase or two and a notion or two. Observe the
  advantage of writing the baptismal name at full length.</p>

<p class="cenhead">SPECULATIVE THOUGHT IN ENGLAND.</p>

  <p>In the year 1845 the old <i>Mathematical Society</i> was merged in the
  Astronomical Society. The circle-squarers, etc., thrive more in England
  than in any other country: there are most weeds where there is the
  largest crop. Speculation, though not encouraged by our Government so
  much as by those of the Continent, has had, not indeed such forcing, but
  much wider diffusion: few tanks, but many rivulets. On this point I quote
  from the preface to the reprint of the work of Ramchundra,<a
  name="NtA_765" href="#Nt_765"><sup>[765]</sup></a> which I superintended
  for the late Court of Directors of the East India Company.</p>

<p><!-- Page 375 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page375"></a>[375]</span></p>

  <p>"That sound judgment which gives men well to know what is best for
  them, as well as that faculty of invention which leads to development of
  resources and to the increase of wealth and comfort, are both materially
  advanced, perhaps cannot rapidly be advanced without, a great taste for
  pure speculation among the general mass of the people, down to the lowest
  of those who can read and write. England is a marked example. Many
  persons will be surprised at this assertion. They imagine that our
  country is the great instance of the refusal of all <i>unpractical</i>
  knowledge in favor of what is <i>useful</i>. I affirm, on the contrary,
  that there is no country in Europe in which there has been so wide a
  diffusion of speculation, theory, or what other unpractical word the
  reader pleases. In our country, the scientific <i>society</i> is always
  formed and maintained by the people; in every other, the scientific
  <i>academy</i>&mdash;most aptly named&mdash;has been the creation of the
  government, of which it has never ceased to be the nursling. In all the
  parts of England in which manufacturing pursuits have given the artisan
  some command of time, the cultivation of mathematics and other
  speculative studies has been, as is well known, a very frequent
  occupation. In no other country has the weaver at his loom bent over the
  <i>Principia</i> of Newton; in no other country has the man of weekly
  wages maintained his own scientific periodical. With us, since the
  beginning of the last century, scores upon scores&mdash;perhaps hundreds,
  for I am far from knowing all&mdash;of annuals have run, some their ten
  years, some their half-century, some their century and a half, containing
  questions to be answered, from which many of our examiners in the
  universities have culled materials for the academical contests. And these
  questions have always been answered, and in cases without number by the
  lower order of purchasers, the mechanics, the weavers, and the printers'
  workmen. I cannot here digress to point out the manner in which the
  concentration of manufactures, and the general diffusion of education,
  have affected the <!-- Page 376 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page376"></a>[376]</span>state of things; I speak of the time
  during which the present system took its rise, and of the circumstances
  under which many of its most effective promoters were trained. In all
  this there is nothing which stands out, like the state-nourished academy,
  with its few great names and brilliant single achievements. This country
  has differed from all others in the wide diffusion of the disposition to
  speculate, which disposition has found its place among the ordinary
  habits of life, moderate in its action, healthy in its amount."</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="cenhead">THE OLD MATHEMATICAL SOCIETY.</p>

  <p>Among the most remarkable proofs of the diffusion of speculation was
  the Mathematical Society, which flourished from 1717 to 1845. Its habitat
  was Spitalfields, and I think most of its existence was passed in Crispin
  Street. It was originally a plain society, belonging to the studious
  artisan. The members met for discussion once a week; and I believe I am
  correct in saying that each man had his pipe, his pot, and his problem.
  One of their old rules was that, "If any member shall so far forget
  himself and the respect due to the Society as in the warmth of debate to
  threaten or offer personal violence to any other member, he shall be
  liable to immediate expulsion, or to pay such fine as the majority of the
  members present shall decide." But their great rule, printed large on the
  back of the title page of their last book of regulations, was "By the
  constitution of the Society, it is the duty of every member, if he be
  asked any mathematical or philosophical question by another member, to
  instruct him in the plainest and easiest manner he is able." We shall
  presently see that, in old time, the rule had a more homely form.</p>

  <p>I have been told that De Moivre<a name="NtA_766"
  href="#Nt_766"><sup>[766]</sup></a> was a member of this <!-- Page 377
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page377"></a>[377]</span>Society. This
  I cannot verify: circumstances render it unlikely; even though the French
  refugees clustered in Spitalfields; many of them were of the Society,
  which there is some reason to think was founded by them. But Dolland,<a
  name="NtA_767" href="#Nt_767"><sup>[767]</sup></a> Thomas Simpson,<a
  name="NtA_768" href="#Nt_768"><sup>[768]</sup></a> Saunderson,<a
  name="NtA_769" href="#Nt_769"><sup>[769]</sup></a> Crossley,<a
  name="NtA_770" href="#Nt_770"><sup>[770]</sup></a> and others of known
  name, were certainly members. The Society gradually declined, and in 1845
  was reduced to nineteen members. An arrangement was made by which sixteen
  of these members, who where not already in the Astronomical Society
  became Fellows without contribution, all the books and other property of
  the old Society being transferred to the new one. I was one of the
  committee which made the preliminary inquiries, and the reason of the
  decline was soon manifest. The only question which could arise was
  whether the members of the society of working men&mdash;for this repute
  still continued&mdash;were of that class of educated men who could
  associate with the Fellows of the Astronomical Society on terms agreeable
  to all parties. We found that the artisan element had been extinct for
  many years; there was not a man but might, as to education, manners, and
  position, have become a Fellow in the usual way. The fact was that life
  in Spitalfields had become harder: and the weaver could <!-- Page 378
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page378"></a>[378]</span>only live from
  hand to mouth, and not up to the brain. The material of the old Society
  no longer existed.</p>

  <p>In 1798, experimental lectures were given, a small charge for
  admission being taken at the door: by this hangs a tale&mdash;and a song.
  Many years ago, I found among papers of a deceased friend, who certainly
  never had anything to do with the Society, and who passed all his life
  far from London, a song, headed "Song sung by the Mathematical Society in
  London, at a dinner given Mr. Fletcher,<a name="NtA_771"
  href="#Nt_771"><sup>[771]</sup></a> a solicitor, who had defended the
  Society gratis." Mr. Williams,<a name="NtA_772"
  href="#Nt_772"><sup>[772]</sup></a> the Assistant Secretary of the
  Astronomical Society, formerly Secretary of the Mathematical Society,
  remembered that the Society had had a solicitor named Fletcher among the
  members. Some years elapsed before it struck me that my old friend
  Benjamin Gompertz,<a name="NtA_773" href="#Nt_773"><sup>[773]</sup></a>
  who had long been a member, might have some recollection of the matter.
  The following is an extract of a letter from him (July 9, 1861):</p>

  <p>"As to the Mathematical Society, of which I was a member when only 18
  years of age, [Mr. G. was born in 1779], having been, contrary to the
  rules, elected under the age of 21. How I came to be a member of that
  Society&mdash;and continued so until it joined the Astronomical Society,
  and was then the President&mdash;was: I happened to pass a bookseller's
  small shop, of second-hand books, kept by a poor taylor, but a good
  mathematician, John Griffiths. I was very pleased to meet a
  mathematician, and I asked him if he would give me some lessons; and his
  reply was that I was more capable to teach him, but he belonged to a
  society of mathematicians, and he would introduce me. I accepted the
  offer, and I was elected, and had many scholars then to teach, as <!--
  Page 379 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page379"></a>[379]</span>one
  of the rules was, if a member asked for information, and applied to any
  one who could give it, he was obliged to give it, or fine one penny.
  Though I might say much with respect to the Society which would be
  interesting, I will for the present reply only to your question. I well
  knew Mr. Fletcher, who was a very clever and very scientific person. He
  did, as solicitor, defend an action brought by an informer against the
  Society&mdash;I think for 5,000<i>l.</i>&mdash;for giving lectures to the
  public in philosophical subjects [i.e., for unlicensed public exhibition
  with money taken at the doors]. I think the price for admission was one
  shilling, and we used to have, if I rightly recollect, from two to three
  hundred visitors. Mr. Fletcher was successful in his defence, and we got
  out of our trouble. There was a collection made to reward his services,
  but he did not accept of any reward: and I think we gave him a dinner, as
  you state, and enjoyed ourselves; no doubt with astronomical songs and
  other songs; but my recollection does not enable me to say if the
  astronomical song was a drinking song. I think the anxiety caused by that
  action was the cause of some of the members' death. [They had, no doubt,
  broken the law in ignorance; and by the sum named, the informer must have
  been present, and sued for a penalty on every shilling he could prove to
  have been taken]."</p>

  <p>I by no means guarantee that the whole song I proceed to give is what
  was sung at the dinner: I suspect, by the completeness of the chain, that
  augmentations have been made. My deceased friend was just the man to add
  some verses, or the addition may have been made before it came into his
  hands, or since his decease, for the scraps containing the verses passed
  through several hands before they came into mine. We may, however, be
  pretty sure that the original is substantially contained in what is
  given, and that the character is therefore preserved. I have had myself
  to repair damages every now and then, in the way of conjectural
  restoration of defects caused by ill-usage. <!-- Page 380 --><span

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="cenhead">LE VERRIER'S<a name="NtA_792" href="#Nt_792"><sup>[792]</sup></a> PLANET.</p>

  <p>We have received, at the last moment before making up for press, the
  following letter from Sir John Herschel,<a name="NtA_793"
  href="#Nt_793"><sup>[793]</sup></a> <!-- Page 384 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page384"></a>[384]</span>in reference to the
  matter referred to in the communication from Mr. Hind<a name="NtA_794"
  href="#Nt_794"><sup>[794]</sup></a> given below:</p>

  <p class="author">"Collingwood, Oct. 1.

  <p>"In my address to the British Association assembled at Southampton, on
  the occasion of my resigning the chair to Sir R. Murchison,<a
  name="NtA_795" href="#Nt_795"><sup>[795]</sup></a> I stated, among the
  remarkable astronomical events of the last twelvemonth, that it had added
  a new planet to our list,&mdash;adding, 'it has done more,&mdash;it has
  given us the probable prospect of the discovery of another. We see it as
  Columbus saw America from the shores of Spain. Its movements have been
  felt, trembling along the far-reaching line of our analysis, with a
  certainty hardly inferior to that of ocular demonstration.'&mdash;These
  expressions are not reported in any of the papers which profess to give
  an account of the proceedings, but I appeal to all present whether they
  were not used.</p>

  <p>"Give me leave to state my reasons for this confidence; and, in so
  doing, to call attention to some facts which deserve to be put on record
  in the history of this noble discovery. On July 12, 1842, the late
  illustrious astronomer, Bessel,<a name="NtA_796"
  href="#Nt_796"><sup>[796]</sup></a> honored me with a visit at my present
  residence. On the evening of that day, conversing on the great work of
  the planetary reductions undertaken by the Astronomer Royal<a
  name="NtA_797" href="#Nt_797"><sup>[797]</sup></a>&mdash;then in
  progress, and since published,<a name="NtA_798"
  href="#Nt_798"><sup>[798]</sup></a>&mdash;M. Bessel remarked that the
  motions of Uranus, as he had satisfied <!-- Page 385 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page385"></a>[385]</span>himself by careful
  examination of the recorded observations, could not be accounted for by
  the perturbations of the known planets; and that the deviations far
  exceeded any possible limits of error of observation. In reply to the
  question, Whether the deviations in question might not be due to the
  action of an unknown planet?&mdash;he stated that he considered it highly
  probable that such was the case,&mdash;being systematic, and such as
  might be produced by an exterior planet. I then inquired whether he had
  attempted, from the indications afforded by these perturbations, to
  discover the position of the unknown body,&mdash;in order that 'a hue and
  cry' might be raised for it. From his reply, the words of which I do not
  call to mind, I collected that he had not then gone into that inquiry;
  but proposed to do so, having now completed certain works which had
  occupied too much of his time. And, accordingly, in a letter which I
  received from him after his return to Königsberg, dated November 14,
  1842, he says,&mdash;'In reference to our conversation at Collingwood, I
  <i>announce</i> to you (<i>melde</i> ich Ihnen) that Uranus is not
  forgotten.' Doubtless, therefore, among his papers will be found some
  researches on the subject.</p>

  <p>"The remarkable calculations of M. Le Verrier&mdash;which have pointed
  out, as now appears, nearly the true situation of the new planet, by
  resolving the inverse problem of the perturbations&mdash;if
  uncorroborated by repetition of the numerical calculations by another
  hand, or by independent investigation from another quarter, would hardly
  justify so strong an assurance as that conveyed by my expressions above
  alluded to. But it was known to me, at that time, (I will take the
  liberty to cite the Astronomer Royal as my authority) that a similar
  investigation had been independently entered into, and a conclusion as to
  the situation of the new planet very nearly coincident with M. Le
  Verrier's arrived at (in entire ignorance of his conclusions), by a young
  Cambridge mathematician, Mr. Adams;<a name="NtA_799"
  href="#Nt_799"><sup>[799]</sup></a>&mdash;who will, I hope, <!-- Page 386
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page386"></a>[386]</span>pardon this
  mention of his name (the matter being one of great historical
  moment),&mdash;and who will, doubtless, in his own good time and manner,
  place his calculations before the public.</p>

<p class="cenhead">THE NEW PLANET.</p>

  <p class="author">"Cambridge Observatory, Oct. 15.

  <p>"The allusion made by Sir John Herschel, in his letter contained in
  the <i>Athenæum</i> of October 3, to the theoretical researches of Mr.
  Adams, respecting the newly-discovered planet, has induced me to request
  that you would make the following communication public. It is right that
  I should first say that I have Mr. Adams's permission to make the
  statements that follow, so far as they relate to his labors. I do not
  propose to enter into a detail of the steps by which Mr. Adams was led,
  by his spontaneous and independent researches, to a conclusion that a
  planet must exist more distant than Uranus. The matter is of too great
  historical moment not to receive a more formal record than it would be
  proper to give here. My immediate object is to show, while the attention
  of the scientific public is more particularly directed to the subject,
  that, with respect to this remarkable discovery, English astronomers may
  lay claim to some merit.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Adams formed the resolution of trying, by calculation, to account
  for the anomalies in the motion of Uranus on the hypothesis of a more
  distant planet, when he was an undergraduate in this university, and when
  his exertions for the academical distinction, which he obtained in
  January 1843, left him no time for pursuing the research. In the course
  of that year, he arrived at an approximation to the position of the
  supposed planet; which, however, he did not consider to be worthy of
  confidence, on account of his not <!-- Page 388 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page388"></a>[388]</span>having employed a
  sufficient number of observations of Uranus. Accordingly, he requested my
  intervention to obtain for him the early Greenwich observations, then in
  course of reduction;&mdash;which the Astronomer Royal immediately
  supplied, in the kindest possible manner. This was in February, 1844. In
  September, 1845, Mr. Adams communicated to me values which he had
  obtained for the heliocentric longitude, excentricity of orbit, longitude
  of perihelion, and mass, of an assumed exterior planet,&mdash;deduced
  entirely from unaccounted-for perturbations of Uranus. The same results,
  somewhat corrected, he communicated, in October, to the Astronomer Royal.
  M. Le Verrier, in an investigation which was published in June of 1846,
  assigned very nearly the same heliocentric longitude for the probable
  position of the planet as Mr. Adams had arrived at, but gave no results
  respecting its mass and the form of its orbit. The coincidence as to
  position from two entirely independent investigations naturally inspired
  confidence; and the Astronomer Royal shortly after suggested the
  employing of the Northumberland telescope of this observatory in a
  systematic search after the hypothetical planet; recommending, at the
  same time, a definite plan of operations. I undertook to make the
  search,&mdash;and commenced observing on July 29. The observations were
  directed, in the first instance, to the part of the heavens which theory
  had pointed out as the most probable place of the planet; in selecting
  which I was guided by a paper drawn up for me by Mr. Adams. Not having
  hour xxi. of the Berlin star-maps&mdash;of the publication of which I was
  not aware&mdash;I had to proceed on the principle of comparison of
  observations made at intervals. On July 30, I went over a zone 9' broad,
  in such a manner as to include all stars to the eleventh magnitude. On
  August 4, I took a broader zone and recorded a place of the planet. My
  next observations were on August 12; when I met with a star of the eighth
  magnitude in the zone which I had gone over on July 30,&mdash;and which
  did not then <!-- Page 389 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page389"></a>[389]</span>contain this star. Of course, this was the
  planet;&mdash;the place of which was, thus, recorded a second time in
  four days of observing. A comparison of the observations of July 30 and
  August 12 would, according to the principle of search which I employed,
  have shown me the planet. I did not make the comparison till after the
  detection of it at Berlin&mdash;partly because I had an impression that a
  much more extensive search was required to give any probability of
  discovery&mdash;and partly from the press of other occupation. The
  planet, however, was <i>secured</i>, and two positions of it recorded six
  weeks earlier here than in any other observatory,&mdash;and in a
  systematic search expressly undertaken for that purpose. I give now the
  positions of the planet on August 4 and August 12.</p>

  <p>"From these places compared with recent observations Mr. Adams has
  obtained the following results:</p>

  <p>"The present distance from the sun is, therefore, thirty times the
  earth's mean distance;&mdash;which is somewhat less than the theory had
  indicated. The other elements of the orbit cannot be approximated to till
  the observations shall have been continued for a longer period.</p>

  <p>"The part taken by Mr. Adams in the theoretical search after this
  planet will, perhaps, be considered to justify the suggesting of a name.
  With his consent, I mention <i>Oceanus</i> as one which may possibly
  receive the votes of astronomers.&mdash;I <!-- Page 390 --><span

<p class="cenhead">ASTRONOMICAL POLICE REPORT.</p>

  <p>"An ill-looking kind of a body, who declined to give any name, was
  brought before the Academy of Sciences, charged with having assaulted a
  gentleman of the name of Uranus in the public highway. The prosecutor was
  a youngish looking person, wrapped up in two or three great coats; and
  looked chillier than anything imaginable, except the
  prisoner,&mdash;whose teeth absolutely shook, all the time.</p>

  <p>Policeman Le Verrier<a name="NtA_804"
  href="#Nt_804"><sup>[804]</sup></a> stated that he saw the prosecutor
  walking along the pavement,&mdash;and sometimes turning sideways, and
  sometimes running up to the railings and jerking about in a strange way.
  Calculated that somebody must be pulling his coat, or otherwise
  assaulting him. It was so dark that he could not see; but thought, if he
  watched the direction in which the next odd move was made, he might find
  out something. When the time came, he set Brünnow, a constable in another
  division of the same force, to watch where he told him; and Brünnow
  caught the prisoner lurking about in the very spot,&mdash;trying to look
  as if he was minding his own business. Had suspected for a long time that
  somebody was lurking about in the neighborhood. Brünnow was then called,
  and deposed to his catching the prisoner as described.</p>

  <p><i>M. Arago.</i>&mdash;Was the prosecutor sober?</p>

  <p><i>Le Verrier.</i>&mdash;Lord, yes, your worship; no man who had a
  drop in him ever looks so cold as he did.</p>

  <p><i>M. Arago.</i>&mdash;Did you see the assault?</p>

  <p><i>Le Verrier.</i>&mdash;I can't say I did; but I told Brünnow exactly
  how he'd be crouched down;&mdash;just as he was.</p>

<p><!-- Page 391 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page391"></a>[391]</span></p>

  <p><i>M. Arago (to Brünnow).</i>&mdash;Did <i>you</i> see the
  assault?</p>

  <p><i>Brünnow.</i>&mdash;No, your worship; but I caught the prisoner.</p>

  <p><i>M. Arago.</i>&mdash;How did you know there was any assault at
  all?</p>

  <p><i>Le Verrier.</i>&mdash;I reckoned it couldn't be otherwise, when I
  saw the prosecutor making those odd turns on the pavement.</p>

  <p><i>M. Arago.</i>&mdash;You reckon and you calculate! Why, you'll tell
  me, next, that you policemen may sit at home and find out all that's
  going on in the streets by arithmetic. Did you ever bring a case of this
  kind before me till now?</p>

  <p><i>Le Verrier.</i>&mdash;Why, you see, your worship, the police are
  growing cleverer and cleverer every day. We can't help it:&mdash;it grows
  upon us.</p>

  <p><i>M. Arago.</i>&mdash;You're getting too clever for me. What does the
  prosecutor know about the matter?</p>

  <p>The prosecutor said, all he knew was that he was pulled behind by
  somebody several times. On being further examined, he said that he had
  seen the prisoner often, but did not know his name, nor how he got his
  living; but had understood he was called Neptune. He himself had paid
  rates and taxes a good many years now. Had a family of six,&mdash;two of
  whom got their own living.</p>

  <p>The prisoner being called on for his defence, said that it was a
  quarrel. He had pushed the prosecutor&mdash;and the prosecutor had pushed
  him. They had known each other a long time, and were always
  quarreling;&mdash;he did not know why. It was their nature, he supposed.
  He further said, that the prosecutor had given a false account of
  himself;&mdash;that he went about under different names. Sometimes he was
  called Uranus, sometimes Herschel, and sometimes Georgium Sidus; and he
  had no character for regularity in the neighborhood. Indeed, he was
  sometimes not to be seen for a long time at once.</p>

  <p>The prosecutor, on being asked, admitted, after a little hesitation,
  that he had pushed and pulled the prisoner too. <!-- Page 392 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page392"></a>[392]</span>In the altercation
  which followed, it was found very difficult to make out which
  began:&mdash;and the worthy magistrate seemed to think they must have
  begun together.</p>

  <p><i>M. Arago.</i>&mdash;Prisoner, have you any family?</p>

  <p>The prisoner declined answering that question at present. He said he
  thought the police might as well reckon it out whether he had or not.</p>

  <p><i>M. Arago</i> said he didn't much differ from that opinion.&mdash;He
  then addressed both prosecutor and prisoner; and told them that if they
  couldn't settle their differences without quarreling in the streets, he
  should certainly commit them both next time. In the meantime, he called
  upon both to enter into their own recognizances; and directed the police
  to have an eye upon both,&mdash;observing that the prisoner would be
  likely to want it a long time, and the prosecutor would be not a hair the
  worse for it."</p>

  <p>This quib was written by a person who was among the astronomers: and
  it illustrates the fact that Le Verrier had sole possession of the field
  until Mr. Challis's letter appeared. Sir John Herschel's <span

  communication should have paved the way: but the wonder of the discovery
  drove it out of many heads. There is an excellent account of the whole
  matter in Professor Grant's<a name="NtA_805"

  The squib scandalized some grave people, who wrote severe admonitions to
  the editor. There are formalists who spend much time in writing propriety
  to journals, to which they serve as foolometers. In a letter to the
  <i>Athenæum</i>, speaking of the way in which people hawk fine terms for
  common things, I said that these people ought to have a new translation
  of the Bible, which should contain the verse "gentleman and lady, created
  He them." The editor was handsomely fired and brimstoned!</p>

  <p>The author replied to a criticism in the <i>Athenæum</i>, and I
  remember how, in a very few words, he showed that he had read nothing on
  the subject. The reviewer spoke of the forces of the planets (i.e., the
  Sun and Moon) on the ocean, on which the author remarks, "But N.B. the
  Sun is no planet, Mr. Critic." Had he read any of the actual
  investigations on the usual theory, he would have known that to this day
  the sun and moon continue to be called <i>planets</i>&mdash;though the
  phrase is disappearing&mdash;in speaking of the tides; the sense, of
  course, being the old one, wandering bodies.</p>

  <p>A large class of the paradoxers, when they meet with something which
  taken in their sense is absurd, do not take the trouble to find out the
  intended meaning, but walk off with the words laden with their own first
  construction. Such men are hardly fit to walk the streets without an
  interpreter. I was startled for a moment, at the time when a recent
  happy&mdash;and more recently happier&mdash;marriage occupied the public
  thoughts, by seeing in a haberdasher's window, in staring large letters,
  an unpunctuated sentence which read itself to me as "Princess Alexandra!
  collar and cuff!" It immediately occurred to me that had I been any one
  of some scores of my paradoxers, I should, no doubt, have proceeded to
  raise the mob against the unscrupulous person who dared to hint to a
  young bride such maleficent&mdash;or at least immellificent&mdash;conduct
  towards her new lord. But, as it was, certain material contexts in the
  shop window suggested a less <!-- Page 394 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page394"></a>[394]</span>savage explanation. A paradoxer should not
  stop at reading the advertisements of Newton or Laplace; he should learn
  to look at the stock of goods.</p>

  <p>I think I must have an eye for double readings, when presented: though
  I never guess riddles. On the day on which I first walked into the
  <i>Panizzi</i> reading room<a name="NtA_807"
  href="#Nt_807"><sup>[807]</sup></a>&mdash;as it ought to be
  called&mdash;at the Museum, I began my circuit of the wall-shelves at the
  ladies' end: and perfectly coincided in the propriety of the Bibles and
  theological works being placed there. But the very first book I looked on
  the back of had, in flaming gold letters, the following
  inscription&mdash;"Blast the Antinomians!"<a name="NtA_808"
  href="#Nt_808"><sup>[808]</sup></a> If a line had been drawn below the
  first word, Dr. Blast's history of the Antinomians would not have been so
  fearfully misinterpreted. It seems that neither the binder nor the
  arranger of the room had caught my reading. The book was removed before
  the catalogue of books of reference was printed.</p>

</blockquote>

<p><!-- Page 395 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page395"></a>[395]</span></p>

  <p>A very handsomely printed volume, with beautiful plates. Many readers
  who have heard of Muggletonians have never had any distinct idea of
  Lodowick Muggleton,<a name="NtA_810" href="#Nt_810"><sup>[810]</sup></a>
  the inspired tailor, (1608-1698) who about 1650 received his commission
  from heaven, wrote a Testament, founded a sect, and descended to
  posterity. Of Reeve<a name="NtA_811" href="#Nt_811"><sup>[811]</sup></a>
  less is usually said; according to Mr. Frost, he and Muggleton are the
  two "witnesses." I shall content myself with one specimen of Mr. Frost's
  science:</p>

  <p>"I was once invited to hear read over 'Guthrie<a name="NtA_812"
  href="#Nt_812"><sup>[812]</sup></a> on Astronomy,' and when the reading
  was concluded I was asked my opinion thereon; when I said, 'Doctor, it
  appears to me that Sir I. Newton has only given two proofs in support of
  his theory of the earth revolving round the sun: all the rest is
  assertion without any proofs.'&mdash;'What are they?' inquired the
  Doctor.&mdash;'Well,' I said, 'they are, first, the power of <!-- Page
  396 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page396"></a>[396]</span>attraction
  to keep the earth to the sun; the second is the power of repulsion, by
  virtue of the centrifugal motion of the earth: all the rest appears to me
  assertion without proof.' The Doctor considered a short time and then
  said, 'It certainly did appear so.' I said, 'Sir Isaac has certainly
  obtained the credit of completing the system, but really he has only half
  done his work.'&mdash;'How is that,' inquired my friend the Doctor. My
  reply was this: 'You will observe his system shows the earth traverses
  round the sun on an inclined plane; the consequence is, there are four
  powers required to make his system complete:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>1st. The power of <i>attraction</i>.</p>
      <p>2ndly. The power of <i>repulsion</i>.</p>
      <p>3rdly. The power of <i>ascending</i> the inclined plane.</p>
      <p>4thly. The power of <i>descending</i> the inclined plane.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>You will thus easily see the <i>four</i> powers required, and Newton
  has only accounted for <i>two</i>; the work is therefore only half done.'
  Upon due reflection the Doctor said, 'It certainly was necessary to have
  these <i>four</i> points cleared up before the system could be said to be
  complete.'"</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>I have no doubt that Mr. Frost, and many others on my list, have
  really encountered doctors who could be puzzled by such stuff as this, or
  nearly as bad, among the votaries of existing systems, and have been
  encouraged thereby to print their objections. But justice requires me to
  say that from the words "power of repulsion by virtue of the centrifugal
  motion of the earth," Mr. Frost may be suspected of having something more
  like a notion of the much-mistaken term "centrifugal force" than many
  paradoxers of greater fame. The Muggletonian sect is not altogether
  friendless: over and above this handsome volume, the works of Reeve and
  Muggleton were printed, in 1832, in three quarto volumes. See <i>Notes
  and Queries, 1st Series</i>, v, 80; 3d Series, iii, 303. <!-- Page 397
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page397"></a>[397]</span></p>

  <p>[The system laid down by Mr. Frost, though intended to be
  substantially that of Lodowick Muggleton, is not so vagarious. It is
  worthy of note how very different have been the fates of two contemporary
  paradoxers, Muggleton and George Fox.<a name="NtA_813"
  href="#Nt_813"><sup>[813]</sup></a> They were friends and associates,<a
  name="NtA_814" href="#Nt_814"><sup>[814]</sup></a> and commenced their
  careers about the same time, 1647-1650. The followers of Fox have made
  their sect an institution, and deserve to be called the pioneers of
  philanthropy. But though there must still be Muggletonians, since
  expensive books are published by men who take the name, no sect of that
  name is known to the world. Nevertheless, Fox and Muggleton are men of
  one type, developed by the same circumstances: it is for those who
  investigate such men to point out why their teachings have had fates so
  different. Macaulay says it was because Fox found followers of more sense
  than himself. True enough: but why did Fox find such followers and not
  Muggleton? The two were equally crazy, to all appearance: and the
  difference required must be sought in the doctrines themselves.</p>

  <p>Fox was not a <i>rational</i> man: but the success of his sect and
  doctrines entitles him to a letter of alteration of the phrase which I am
  surprised has not become current. When Conduitt,<a name="NtA_815"
  href="#Nt_815"><sup>[815]</sup></a> the husband of Newton's half-niece,
  wrote a circular to Newton's friends, just after his death, inviting them
  to bear their parts in a proper biography, he said, "As Sir I. Newton was
  a <i>national</i> man, I think every one ought to contribute to a work
  intended to do him justice." Here is the very phrase which is often
  wanted to signify that <!-- Page 398 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page398"></a>[398]</span>celebrity which puts its mark, good or
  bad, on the national history, in a manner which cannot be asserted of
  many notorious or famous historical characters. Thus George Fox and
  Newton are both <i>national</i> men. Dr. Roget's<a name="NtA_816"
  href="#Nt_816"><sup>[816]</sup></a> <i>Thesaurus</i> gives more than
  fifty synonyms&mdash;<i>colleagues</i> would be the better word&mdash;of
  "<i>celebrated</i>," any one of which might be applied, either in prose
  or poetry, to Newton or to his works, no one of which comes near to the
  meaning which Conduitt's adjective immediately suggests.</p>

  <p>The truth is, that we are too <i>monarchical</i> to be
  <i>national</i>. We have the Queen's army, the Queen's navy, the Queen's
  highway, the Queen's English, etc.; nothing is national except the
  <i>debt</i>. That this remark is not new is an addition to its force; it
  has hardly been repeated since it was first made. It is some excuse that
  <i>nation</i> is not vernacular English: the <i>country</i> is our word,
  and <i>country man</i> is appropriated.]</p>

  proof of the existence of God? 8vo. 1847.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>This acorn of the holy oak was forwarded to me with a manuscript note,
  signed by the editor, on the part of the <!-- Page 400 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page400"></a>[400]</span>"London Society of
  Theological Utilitarians," who say, "they trust you may be induced to
  give this momentous subject your consideration." The supposition that a
  middle-aged person, known as a student of thought on more subjects than
  one, had that particular subject yet to begin, is a specimen of what I
  will call the <i>assumption-trick</i> of controversy, a habit which
  pervades all sides of all subjects. The tract is a proof of the good
  policy of letting opinions find their level, without any assistance from
  the Court of Queen's Bench. Twenty years earlier the thesis would have
  been positive, "There is sufficient proof of the non-existence of God,"
  and bitter in its tone. As it stands, we have a moderate and respectful
  treatment&mdash;wrong only in making the opponent argue absurdly, as
  usually happens when one side invents the other&mdash;of a question in
  which a great many Christians have agreed with the atheist: that question
  being&mdash;Can the existence of God be proved independently of
  revelation? Many very religious persons answer this question in the
  negative, as well as Mr. Holyoake. And, this point being settled, all who
  agree in the negative separate into those who can endure scepticism, and
  those who cannot: the second class find their way to Christianity. This
  very number of <i>The Reasoner</i> announces the secession of one of its
  correspondents, and his adoption of the Christian faith. This would not
  have happened twenty years before: nor, had it happened, would it have
  been respectfully announced.</p>

  <p>There are people who are very unfortunate in the expression of their
  meaning. Mr. Holyoake, in the name of the "London Society" etc.,
  forwarded a pamphlet on the existence of God, and said that the Society
  trusted I "may be induced to give" the subject my "consideration." How
  could I know the Society was one person, who supposed I had arrived at a
  conclusion and wanted a "<i>guiding word</i>"? But so it seems it was:
  Mr. Holyoake, in the <i>English <!-- Page 401 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page401"></a>[401]</span>Leader</i> of October 15, 1864, and in a
  private letter to me, writes as follows:</p>

  <p>"The gentleman who was the author of the argument, and who asked me to
  send it to Mr. De Morgan, never assumed that that gentleman had 'that
  particular subject to begin'&mdash;on the contrary, he supposed that one
  whom we all knew to be eminent as a thinker <i>had</i> come to a
  conclusion upon it, and would perhaps vouchsafe a guiding word to one who
  was, as yet, seeking the solution of the Great Problem of Theology. I
  told my friend that 'Mr. De Morgan was doubtless preoccupied, and that he
  must be content to wait. On some day of courtesy and leisure he might
  have the kindness to write.' Nor was I wrong&mdash;the answer appears in
  your pages at the lapse of seventeen years."</p>

  <p>I suppose Mr. Holyoake's way of putting his request was the <i>stylus
  curiæ</i> of the Society. A worthy Quaker who was sued for debt in the
  King's Bench was horrified to find himself charged in the declaration
  with detaining his creditor's money by force and arms, contrary to the
  peace of our Lord the King, etc. It's only the <i>stylus curiæ</i>, said
  a friend: I don't know <i>curiæ</i>, said the Quaker, but he shouldn't
  style us peace-breakers.</p>

  <p>The notion that the <i>non</i>-existence of God can be <i>proved</i>,
  has died out under the light of discussion: had the only lights shone
  from the pulpit and the prison, so great a step would never have been
  made. The question now is as above. The dictum that Christianity is "part
  and parcel of the law of the land" is also abrogated: at the same time,
  and the coincidence is not an accident, it is becoming somewhat nearer
  the truth that the law of the land is part and parcel of Christianity. It
  must also be noticed that <i>Christianity</i> was part and parcel of the
  articles of <i>war</i>; and so was <i>duelling</i>. Any officer speaking
  against religion was to be cashiered; and any officer receiving an
  affront without, in the last resort, attempting to kill his opponent, was
  also to be cashiered. Though somewhat of a book-hunter, I <!-- Page 402
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page402"></a>[402]</span>have never
  been able to ascertain the date of the collected remonstrances of the
  prelates in the House of Lords against this overt inculcation of murder,
  under the soft name of <i>satisfaction</i>: it is neither in Watt,<a
  name="NtA_821" href="#Nt_821"><sup>[821]</sup></a> nor in Lowndes,<a
  name="NtA_822" href="#Nt_822"><sup>[822]</sup></a> nor in any edition of
  Brunet;<a name="NtA_823" href="#Nt_823"><sup>[823]</sup></a> and there is
  no copy in the British Museum. Was the collected edition really
  published?</p>

  <p>[The publication of the above in the <i>Athenæum</i> has not produced
  reference to a single copy. The collected edition seems to be doubted. I
  have even met one or two persons who doubt the fact of the Bishops having
  remonstrated at all: but their doubt was founded on an absurd
  supposition, namely, that it was <i>no business of theirs</i>; that it
  was not the business of the prelates of the church in union with the
  state to remonstrate against the Crown commanding murder! Some say that
  the edition was published, but under an irrelevant title, which prevented
  people from knowing what it was about. Such things have happened: for
  example, arranged extracts from Wellington's general orders, which would
  have attracted attention, fell dead under the title of "Principles of
  War." It is surmised that the book I am looking for also contains the
  protests of the Reverend bench against other things besides the
  Thou-shalt-do-murder of the Articles (of war), and is called "First
  Elements of Religion" or some similar title. Time clears up all
  things.]</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_25" href="#NtA_25">[25]</a> So in the original, for
  Barrême. François Barrême was to France what Cocker was to England. He
  was born at Lyons in 1640, and died at Paris in 1703. He published
  several arithmetics, dedicating them to his patron, Colbert. One of the
  best known of his works is <i>L'arithmétique, ou le livre facile pour
  apprendre l'arithmétique soi-mème</i>, 1677. The French word
  <i>barême</i> or <i>barrême</i>, a ready-reckoner, is derived from his
  name.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_26" href="#NtA_26">[26]</a> Born at Rome, about 480 A.D.;
  died at Pavia, 524. Gibbon speaks of him as "the last of the Romans whom
  Cato or Tully could have acknowledged for their countryman." His works on
  arithmetic, music, and geometry were classics in the medieval
  schools.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_27" href="#NtA_27">[27]</a> Johannes Campanus, of Novarra,
  was chaplain to Pope Urban IV (1261-1264). He was one of the early
  medieval translators of Euclid from the Arabic into Latin, and the first
  printed edition of the <i>Elements</i> (Venice, 1482) was from his
  translation. In this work he probably depended not a little upon at least
  two or three earlier scholars. He also wrote <i>De computo ecclesiastico
  Calendarium</i>, and <i>De quadratura circuli</i>.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_28" href="#NtA_28">[28]</a> Archimedes gave 3-1/7, and
  3-10/71 as the limits of the ratio of the circumference to the diameter
  of a circle.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_29" href="#NtA_29">[29]</a> Friedrich W. A. Murhard was
  born at Cassel in 1779 and died there in 1853. His <i>Bibliotheca
  Mathematica</i>, Leipsic, 1797-1805, is ill arranged and inaccurate, but
  it is still a helpful bibliography. De Morgan speaks somewhere of his
  indebtedness to it.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_30" href="#NtA_30">[30]</a> Abraham Gotthelf Kästner was
  born at Leipsic in 1719, and died at Göttingen in 1800. He was professor
  of mathematics and physics at Göttingen. His <i>Geschichte der
  Mathematik</i> (1796-1800) was a work of considerable merit. In the text
  of the <i>Budget of Paradoxes</i> the name appears throughout as Kastner
  instead of Kästner.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_31" href="#NtA_31">[31]</a> Lucas Gauricus, or Luca
  Gaurico, born at Giffoni, near Naples, in 1476; died at Rome in 1558. He
  was an astrologer and mathematician, and was professor of mathematics at
  Ferrara in 1531. In 1545 he became bishop of Cività Ducale.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_32" href="#NtA_32">[32]</a> John Couch Adams was born at
  Lidcot, Cornwall, in 1819, and died in 1892. He and Leverrier predicted
  the discovery of Neptune from the perturbations in Uranus.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_33" href="#NtA_33">[33]</a> Urbain-Jean-Joseph Leverrier
  was born at Saint-Lô, Manche, in 1811, and died at Paris in 1877. It was
  his data respecting the perturbations of Uranus that were used by Adams
  and himself in locating Neptune.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_34" href="#NtA_34">[34]</a> Joseph-Juste Scaliger, the
  celebrated philologist, was born at Agen in 1540, and died at Leyden in
  1609. His <i>Cyclometrica elementa</i>, to which De Morgan refers,
  appeared at Leyden in 1594.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_35" href="#NtA_35">[35]</a> The title is: <i>In hoc libra

  Carolus Bovillus, or Charles Bouvelles (Boüelles, Bouilles, Bouvel), was
  born at Saucourt, Picardy, about 1470, and died at Noyon about 1533. He
  was canon and professor of theology at Noyon. His <i>Introductio</i>
  contains considerable work on star polygons, a favorite study in the
  Middle Ages and early Renaissance. His work <i>Que hoc volumine
  contin&#x113;tur. Liber de intellectu. Liber de sensu</i>, etc., appeared
  at Paris in 1509-10.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_36" href="#NtA_36">[36]</a> Nicolaus Cusanus, Nicolaus
  Chrypffs or Krebs, was born at Kues on the Mosel in 1401, and died at
  Todi, Umbria, August 11, 1464. He held positions of honor in the church,
  including the bishopric of Brescia. He was made a cardinal in 1448. He
  wrote several works on mathematics, his <i>Opuscula varia</i> appearing
  about 1490, probably at Strasburg, but published without date or place.
  His <i>Opera</i> appeared at Paris in 1511 and again in 1514, and at
  Basel in 1565.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_37" href="#NtA_37">[37]</a> Henry Stephens (born at Paris
  about 1528, died at Lyons in 1598) was one of the most successful
  printers of his day. He was known as <i>Typographus Parisiensis</i>, and
  to his press we owe some of the best works of the period.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_38" href="#NtA_38">[38]</a> Jacobus Faber Stapulensis
  (Jacques le Fèvre d'Estaples) was born at Estaples, near Amiens, in 1455,
  and died at Nérac in 1536. He was a priest, vicar of the bishop of Meaux,
  lecturer on philosophy at the Collège Lemoine in Paris, and tutor to
  Charles, son of Francois I. He wrote on philosophy, theology, and
  mathematics.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_39" href="#NtA_39">[39]</a> Claude-François Milliet de
  Challes was born at Chambéry in 1621, and died at Turin in 1678. He
  edited <i>Euclidis Elementorum libri octo</i> in 1660, and published a
  <i>Cursus seu mundus mathematicus</i>, which included a short history of
  mathematics, in 1674. He also wrote on mathematical geography.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_40" href="#NtA_40">[40]</a> This date should be 1503, if
  he refers to the first edition. It is well known that this is the first
  encyclopedia worthy the name to appear in print. It was written by
  Gregorius Reisch (born at Balingen, and died at Freiburg in 1487), prior
  of the cloister at Freiburg and confessor to Maximilian I. The first
  edition appeared at Freiburg in 1503, and it passed through many editions
  in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. The title of the 1504 edition
  reads: <i>Aepitoma omnis phylosophiae. alias Margarita phylosophica
  tractans de omni genere scibili: Cum additionibus: Quae in alijs non
  habentur</i>.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_41" href="#NtA_41">[41]</a> This is the <i>Introductio in
  arithmeticam Divi S. Boetii.... Epitome rerum geometricarum ex geometrica
  introductio C. Bovilli. De quadratura circuli demonstratio ex
  Campano</i>, that appeared without date about 1507.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_42" href="#NtA_42">[42]</a> Born at Liverpool in 1805, and
  died there about 1872. He was a merchant, and in 1865 he published, at
  Liverpool, a work entitled <i>The Quadrature of the Circle, or the True
  Ratio between the Diameter and Circumference geometrically and
  mathematically demonstrated</i>. In this he gives the ratio as exactly
  3&#x215B;.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_43" href="#NtA_43">[43]</a> "That it would be impossible
  to tell him exactly, since no one had yet been able to find precisely the
  ratio of the circumference to the diameter."</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_44" href="#NtA_44">[44]</a> This is the Paris edition:
  "Parisiis: ex officina Ascensiana anno Christi ... MDXIIII," as appears
  by the colophon of the second volume to which De Morgan refers.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_45" href="#NtA_45">[45]</a> Regiomontanus, or Johann
  Müller of Königsberg (Regiomontanus), was born at Königsberg in
  Franconia, June 5, 1436, and died at Rome July 6, 1476. He studied at
  Vienna under the great astronomer Peuerbach, and was his most famous
  pupil. He wrote numerous works, chiefly on astronomy. He is also known by
  the names Ioannes de Monte Regio, de Regiomonte, Ioannes Germanus de
  Regiomonte, etc.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_46" href="#NtA_46">[46]</a> Henry Cornelius Agrippa was
  born at Cologne in 1486 and died either at Lyons in 1534 or at Grenoble
  in 1535. He was professor of theology at Cologne and also at Turin. After
  the publication of his <i>De Occulta Philosophia</i> he was imprisoned
  for sorcery. Both works appeared at Antwerp in 1530, and each passed
  through a large number of editions. A French translation appeared in
  Paris in 1582, and an English one in London in 1651.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_47" href="#NtA_47">[47]</a> Nicolaus Remegius was born in
  Lorraine in 1554, and died at Nancy in 1600. He was a jurist and
  historian, and held the office of procurator general to the Duke of
  Lorraine.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_48" href="#NtA_48">[48]</a> This was at the storming of
  the city by the British on May 4, 1799. From his having been born in
  India, all this appealed strongly to the interests of De Morgan.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_49" href="#NtA_49">[49]</a> Orontius Finaeus, or Oronce
  Finé, was born at Briançon in 1494 and died at Paris, October 6, 1555. He
  was imprisoned by François I for refusing to recognize the concordat
  (1517). He was made professor of mathematics in the Collège Royal (later
  called the Collège de France) in 1532. He wrote extensively on astronomy
  and geometry, but was by no means a great scholar. He was a pretentious
  man, and his works went through several editions. His
  <i>Protomathesis</i> appeared at Paris in 1530-32. The work referred to
  by De Morgan is the <i>Quadratura circuli tandem inventa &amp; clarissime
  demonstrata</i> ... Lutetiae Parisiorum, 1544, fol. In the 1556 edition
  of his <i>De rebus mathematicis, hactenus desideratis, Libri IIII</i>,
  published at Paris, the subtitle is: <i>Quibus inter cætera, Circuli
  quadratura Centum modis, &amp; suprà, per eundem Orontium recenter
  excogitatis, demonstratus</i>, so that he kept up his efforts until his
  death.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_50" href="#NtA_50">[50]</a> Johannes Buteo (Boteo, Butéon,
  Bateon) was born in Dauphiné c. 1485-1489, and died in a cloister in 1560
  or 1564. Some writers give Charpey as the place and 1492 as the date of
  his birth, and state that he died at Canar in 1572. He belonged to the
  order of St. Anthony, and wrote chiefly on geometry, exposing the
  pretenses of Finaeus. His <i>Opera geometrica</i> appeared at Lyons in
  1554, and his <i>Logistica</i> and <i>De quadratura circuli libri duo</i>
  at Lyons in 1559.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_51" href="#NtA_51">[51]</a> This is the great French
  algebraist, François Viète (Vieta), who was born at Fontenay-le-Comte in
  1540, and died at Paris, December 13, 1603. His well-known <i>Isagoge in
  artem analyticam</i> appeared at Tours in 1591. His <i>Opera
  mathematica</i> was edited by Van Schooten in 1646.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_52" href="#NtA_52">[52]</a> This is the <i>De Rebus
  mathematicis hactenus desideratis, Libri IIII</i>, that appeared in Paris
  in 1556. For the title page see Smith, D. E., <i>Rara Arithmetica</i>,
  Boston, 1908, p. 280.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_53" href="#NtA_53">[53]</a> The title is correct except
  for a colon after <i>Astronomicum</i>. Nicolaus Raimarus Ursus was born
  in Henstede or Hattstede, in Dithmarschen, and died at Prague in 1599 or
  1600. He was a pupil of Tycho Brahe. He also wrote <i>De astronomis
  hypothesibus</i> (1597) and <i>Arithmetica analytica vulgo Cosa oder
  Algebra</i> (1601).</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_54" href="#NtA_54">[54]</a> Born at Dôle, Franche-Comté,
  about 1550, died in Holland about 1600. The work to which reference is
  made is the <i>Quadrature du cercle, ou manière de trouver un quarré égal
  au cercle donné</i>, which appeared at Delft in 1584. Duchesne had the
  courage of his convictions, not only on circle-squaring but on religion
  as well, for he was obliged to leave France because of his conversion to
  Calvinism. De Morgan's statement that his real name is Van der Eycke is
  curious, since he was French born. The Dutch may have translated his name
  when he became professor at Delft, but we might equally well say, that
  his real name was Quercetanus or à Quercu.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_55" href="#NtA_55">[55]</a> This was the father of Adriaan
  Metius (1571-1635). He was a mathematician and military engineer, and
  suggested the ratio 355/113 for <span class="grk">&pi;</span>, a ratio
  afterwards published by his son. The ratio, then new to Europe, had long
  been known and used in China, having been found by Tsu Ch'ung-chih
  (428-499 A.D.).</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_56" href="#NtA_56">[56]</a> This was Jost Bürgi, or Justus
  Byrgius, the Swiss mathematician of whom Kepler wrote in 1627: "Apices
  logistici Justo Byrgio multis annis ante editionem Neperianam viam
  præiverunt ad hos ipsissimos logarithmos." He constructed a table of
  antilogarithms (<i>Arithmetische und geometrische Progress-Tabulen</i>),
  but it was not published until after Napier's work appeared.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_57" href="#NtA_57">[57]</a> Ludolphus Van Ceulen, born at

  mystic writers. The first edition appeared at Bergamo in 1583-84; the
  second, at Bergamo in 1584-85; the third, at Venice in 1585; the fourth,
  at Bergamo in 1590; and the fifth, which De Morgan calls the second, in
  1591. Other editions, before the Paris edition to which he refers,

  among his publications was <i>L'expulsion de la bête triomphante</i>. He
  taught philosophy at Paris and Wittenberg, and some of his works were
  published in England in 1583-86. Whether or not he was roasted alive "for
  the maintenance and defence of the holy Church," as De Morgan states,
  depends upon one's religious point of view. At any rate, he was roasted

  was the first noteworthy treatise on physics printed in England. He
  treated of the earth as a spherical magnet and suggested the variation
  and declination of the needle as a means of finding latitude at sea.</p>

  theory of sight, did some work in hydraulics and agriculture, and was
  well known as an astrologer. His <i>Magiae naturalis libri XX</i> was
  published at Naples in 1589. The above title should read

  <p><a name="Nt_94" href="#NtA_94">[94]</a> Cataldi was born in 1548 and
  died at Bologna in 1626. He was professor of mathematics at Perugia,
  Florence, and Bologna, and is known in mathematics chiefly for his work
  in continued fractions. He was one of the scholarly men of his day.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_95" href="#NtA_95">[95]</a> Georg Joachim Rheticus was
  born at Feldkirch in 1514 and died at Caschau, Hungary, in 1576. He was
  one of the most prominent pupils of Copernicus, his <i>Narratio de libris
  revolutionum Copernici</i> (Dantzig, 1540) having done much to make the
  theory of his master known.</p>

  Grienberger, was born at Halle in Tyrol in 1561, and died at Rome in
  1636. He was, like Clavius, a Jesuit and a mathematician, and he wrote a
  little upon the subject of projections. His <i>Prospectiva nova

  Lansbergius was born at Ghent in 1560, and died at Middelburg in 1632. He
  was a Protestant theologian, and was also a physician and astronomer. He
  was a well-known supporter of Galileo and Copernicus. His
  <i>Commentationes in motum terrae diurnum et annuum</i> appeared at
  Middelburg in 1630 and did much to help the new theory.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_103" href="#NtA_103">[103]</a> Prester (Presbyter, priest)
  John, the legendary Christian king whose realm, in the Middle Ages, was
  placed both in Asia and in Africa, is first mentioned in the chronicles
  of Otto of Freisingen in the 12th century. In the 14th century his
  kingdom was supposed to be Abyssinia.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_104" href="#NtA_104">[104]</a> "It is a profane and
  barbarous nation, dirty and slovenly, who eat their meat half raw and
  drink mare's milk, and who use table-cloths and napkins only to wipe
  their hands and mouths."</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_105" href="#NtA_105">[105]</a> "The great Prester John,
  who is the fourth in rank, is emperor of Ethiopia and of the Abyssinians,
  and boasts of his descent from the race of David, as having descended
  from the Queen of Sheba, Queen of Ethiopia. She, having gone to Jerusalem
  to see the wisdom of Solomon, about the year of the world 2952, returned
  pregnant with a son whom they called Moylech, from whom they claim
  descent in a direct line. And so he glories in being the most ancient
  monarch in the world, saying that his empire has endured for more than
  three thousand years, which no other empire is able to assert. He also
  puts into his titles the following: 'We, the sovereign in my realms,
  uniquely beloved of God, pillar of the faith, sprung from the race of
  Judah, etc.' The boundaries of this empire touch the Red Sea and the
  mountains of Azuma on the east, and on the western side it is bordered by
  the River Nile which separates it from Nubia. To the north lies Egypt,
  and to the south the kingdoms of Congo and Mozambique. It extends forty
  degrees in length, or one thousand twenty-five leagues, from Congo or
  Mozambique on the south to Egypt on the north; and in width it reaches
  from the Nile on the west to the mountains of Azuma on the east, seven
  hundred twenty-five leagues, or twenty-nine degrees. This empire contains
  thirty large provinces, namely Medra, Gaga, Alchy, Cedalon, Mantro,
  Finazam, Barnaquez, Ambiam, Fungy, Angoté, Cigremaon, Gorga, Cafatez,
  Zastanla, Zeth, Barly, Belangana, Tygra, Gorgany, Barganaza, d'Ancut,
  Dargaly, Ambiacatina, Caracogly, Amara, Maon (<i>sic</i>), Guegiera,
  Bally, Dobora, and Macheda. All of these provinces are situated directly
  under the equinoctial line between the tropics of Capricorn and Cancer;
  but they are two hundred fifty leagues nearer our tropic than the other.
  The name of Prester John signifies Great Lord, and is not Priest
  [Presbyter] as many think. He has always been a Christian, but often
  schismatic. At the present time he is a Catholic and recognizes the Pope
  as sovereign pontiff. I met one of his bishops in Jerusalem, and often
  conversed with him through the medium of our guide. He was of grave and
  serious bearing, pleasant of speech, but wonderfully subtle in everything
  he said. He took great delight in what I had to relate concerning our
  beautiful ceremonies and the dignity of our prelates in their pontifical
  vestments. As to other matters I will only say that the Ethiopian is
  joyous and merry, not at all like the Tartar in the matter of filth, nor
  like the wretched Arab. They are refined and subtle, trusting no one,
  wonderfully suspicious, and very devout. They are not at all black as is
  commonly supposed, by which I refer to those who do not live under the
  equator or too near to it, for these are Moors as we shall see."</p>

  <p>With respect to this translation it should be said that the original
  forms of the proper names have been preserved, although they are not
  those found in modern works. It should also be stated that the meaning of
  Prester is not the one that was generally accepted by scholars at the
  time the work was written, nor is it the one accepted to-day. There seems
  to be no doubt that the word is derived from Presbyter as stated in note
  <a href="#Nt_103">103</a> on page <a href="#page71">71</a>, since the
  above-mentioned chronicles of Otto, bishop of Freisingen about the middle
  of the twelfth century, states this fact clearly. Otto received his
  information from the bishop of Gabala (the Syrian Jibal) who told him the
  story of John, <i>rex et sacerdos</i>, or Presbyter John as he liked to
  be called. He goes on to say "Should it be asked why, with all this power
  and splendor, he calls himself merely 'presbyter,' this is because of his
  humility, and because it was not fitting for one whose server was a
  primate and king, whose butler an archbishop and king, whose chamberlain
  a bishop and king, whose master of the horse an archimandrite and king,
  whose chief cook an abbot and king, to be called by such titles as
  these."</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_118" href="#NtA_118">[118]</a> Robert Hooke (1635-1703)
  studied under Robert Boyle at Oxford. He was "Curator of Experiments" to
  the Royal Society and its secretary, and was professor of geometry at
  Gresham College, London. It is true that he was "very little of a
  mathematician" although he wrote on the motion of the earth (1674), on
  helioscopes and other instruments (1675), on the rotation of Jupiter
  (1666), and on barometers and sails.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_119" href="#NtA_119">[119]</a> The son of the Sir William
  mentioned below. He was born in 1792 and died in 1871. He wrote a
  treatise on light (1831) and one on astronomy (1836), and established an
  observatory at the Cape of Good Hope where he made observations during
  1834-1838, publishing them in 1847. On his return to England he was
  knighted, and in 1848 was made president of the Royal Society. The title
  of the work to which reference is made is: <i>A preliminary discourse on

  <p><a name="Nt_131" href="#NtA_131">[131]</a> Colburn was the best known
  of the calculating boys produced in America. He was born at Cabot,
  Vermont, in 1804, and died at Norwich, Vermont, in 1840. Having shown
  remarkable skill in numbers as early as 1810, he was taken to London in
  1812, whence he toured through Great Britain and to Paris. The Earl of
  Bristol placed him in Westminster School (1816-1819). On his return to
  America he became a preacher, and later a teacher of languages.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_132" href="#NtA_132">[132]</a> The history of calculating
  boys is interesting. Mathieu le Coc (about 1664), a boy of Lorraine,
  could extract cube roots at sight at the age of eight. Tom Fuller, a
  Virginian slave of the eighteenth century, although illiterate, gave the
  number of seconds in 7 years 17 days 12 hours after only a minute and a
  half of thought. Jedediah Buxton, an Englishman of the eighteenth
  century, was studied by the Royal Society because of his remarkable
  powers. Ampère, the physicist, made long calculations with pebbles at the
  age of four. Gauss, one of the few infant prodigies to become an adult
  prodigy, corrected his father's payroll at the age of three. One of the
  most remarkable of the French calculating boys was Henri Mondeux. He was
  investigated by Arago, Sturm, Cauchy, and Liouville, for the Académie des
  Sciences, and a report was written by Cauchy. His specialty was the
  solution of algebraic problems mentally. He seems to have calculated
  squares and cubes by a binomial formula of his own invention. He died in
  obscurity, but was the subject of a <i>Biographie</i> by Jacoby (1846).
  George P. Bidder, the Scotch engineer (1806-1878), was exhibited as an
  arithmetical prodigy at the age of ten, and did not attend school until
  he was twelve. Of the recent cases two deserve special mention, Inaudi
  and Diamandi. Jacques Inaudi (born in 1867) was investigated for the
  Académie in 1892 by a commission including Poincaré, Charcot, and Binet.
  (See the <i>Revue des Deux Mondes</i>, June 15, 1892, and the laboratory
  bulletins of the Sorbonne). He has frequently exhibited his remarkable
  powers in America. Périclès Diamandi was investigated by the same
  commission in 1893. See Alfred Binet, <i>Psychologie des Grands
  Calculateurs et Joueurs d'Echecs</i>, Paris, 1894.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_133" href="#NtA_133">[133]</a> John Flamsteed's

  the Astronomer Royal and first head of this observatory.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_134" href="#NtA_134">[134]</a> It seems a pity that De
  Morgan should not have lived to lash those of our time who are demanding
  only the immediately practical in mathematics. His satire would have been
  worth the reading against those who seek to stifle the science they
  pretend to foster.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_135" href="#NtA_135">[135]</a> Ismael Bouillaud, or
  Boulliau, was born in 1605 and died at Paris in 1694. He was well known
  as an astronomer, mathematician, and jurist. He lived with De Thou at
  Paris, and accompanied him to Holland. He traveled extensively, and was
  versed in the astronomical work of the Persians and Arabs. It was in his
  <i>Astronomia philolaica, opus novum</i> (Paris, 1645) that he attacked
  Kepler's laws. His tables were shown to be erroneous by the fact that the
  solar eclipse did not take place as predicted by him in 1645.</p>

  his <i>Lettera sopra l'opinione de' Pittagorici e del Copernico, della
  mobilità della Terra e stabilità del Sole, e il nuovo pittagorico sistema
  del mondo</i>, 4to, Naples, 1615. The condemnation of the Congregation

  death at the early age of thirty-six.</p>

  subject on account of a certain passage of Scripture badly distorted for
  their purposes, shall have dared to criticize and censure this teaching
  of mine, I pay no attention to them, even to the extent of despising
  their judgment as rash. For it is not unknown that Lactantius, a writer
  of prominence in other lines although but little versed in mathematics,
  spoke very childishly about the form of the earth when he ridiculed those
  who declared that it was spherical. Hence it should not seem strange to
  the learned if some shall look upon us in the same way. Mathematics is
  written for mathematicians, to whom these labors of ours will seem, if I
  mistake not, to add something even to the republic of the Church....
  <i>Emend.</i> Here strike out everything from 'if by chance' to the words

  if we consider the matter more carefully it will be seen that the

  refutes the reasons of the ancients proving its immobility. Nevertheless,
  since it seems to speak problematically, in order that it may satisfy the
  learned and keep intact the sequence and unity of the book let it be
  emended as below."</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_146" href="#NtA_146">[146]</a> "<i>Copernicus.</i>
  Therefore why do we still hesitate to concede to it motion which is by
  nature consistent with its form, the more so because the whole universe
  is moving, whose end is not and cannot be known, and not confess that
  there is in the sky an appearance of daily revolution, while on the earth
  there is the truth of it? And in like manner these things are as if
  Virgil's Æneas should say, 'We are borne from the harbor' ...
  <i>Emend.</i> Hence I cannot concede motion to this form, the more so
  because the universe would fall, whose end is not and cannot be known,
  and what appears in the heavens is just as if ..."</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_147" href="#NtA_147">[147]</a> "<i>Copernicus</i>. I also
  add that it would seem very absurd that motion should be ascribed to that
  which contains and locates, and not rather to that which is contained and
  located, that is the earth. <i>Emend.</i> I also add that it is not more

  <p><a name="Nt_186" href="#NtA_186">[186]</a> So in the original edition
  of the <i>Budget</i>. It is Johannem Pellum in the original title. John
  Pell (1610 or 1611-1685) studied at Cambridge and Oxford, and was
  professor of mathematics at Amsterdam (1643-46) and Breda (1646-52). He
  left many manuscripts but published little. His name attaches by accident
  to an interesting equation recently studied with care by Dr. E.&nbsp;E.
  Whitford (New York, 1912).</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_187" href="#NtA_187">[187]</a> Christianus Longomontanus
  (Christen Longberg or Lumborg) was born in 1569 at Longberg, Jutland, and
  died in 1647 at Copenhagen. He was an assistant of Tycho Brahe and
  accepted the diurnal while denying the orbital motion of the earth. His
  <i>Cyclometria e lunulis reciproce demonstrata</i> appeared in 1612 under
  the name of Christen Severin, the latter being his family name. He wrote
  several other works on the quadrature problem, and some treatises on
  astronomy.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_188" href="#NtA_188">[188]</a> The names are really pretty
  well known. Giles Persone de Roberval was born at Roberval near Beauvais
  in 1602, and died at Paris in 1675. He was professor of philosophy at the
  Collège Gervais at Paris, and later at the Collège Royal. He claimed to
  have discovered the theory of indivisibles before Cavalieri, and his work
  is set forth in his <i>Traité des indivisibles</i> which appeared
  posthumously in 1693.</p>

  <p>Hobbes (1588-1679), the political and social philosopher, lived a good
  part of his time (1610-41) in France where he was tutor to several young
  noblemen, including the Cavendishes. His <i>Leviathan</i> (1651) is said
  to have influenced Spinoza, Leibnitz, and Rousseau. His <i>Quadratura
  circuli, cubatio sphaerae, duplicatio cubi ...</i> (London, 1669),
  <i>Rosetum geometricum ...</i> (London, 1671), and <i>Lux Mathematica,
  censura doctrinae Wallisianae contra Rosetum Hobbesii</i> (London, 1674)
  are entirely forgotten to-day. (See a further note, <i>infra</i>.)</p>

  <p>Pierre de Carcavi, a native of Lyons, died at Paris in 1684. He was a
  member of parliament, royal librarian, and member of the Académie des
  Sciences. His attempt to prove the impossibility of the quadrature
  appeared in 1645. He was a frequent correspondent of Descartes.</p>

  <p>Cavendish (1591-1654) was Sir (not Lord) Charles. He was, like De
  Morgan himself, a bibliophile in the domain of mathematics. His life was
  one of struggle, his term as member of parliament under Charles I being
  followed by gallant service in the royal army. After the war he sought
  refuge on the continent where he met most of the mathematicians of his
  day. He left a number of manuscripts on mathematics, which his widow
  promptly disposed of for waste paper. If De Morgan's manuscripts had been
  so treated we should not have had his revision of his <i>Budget of
  Paradoxes</i>.</p>

  <p>Marin Mersenne (1588-1648), a minorite, living in the cloisters at
  Nevers and Paris, was one of the greatest Franciscan scholars. He edited
  Euclid, Apollonius, Archimedes, Theodosius, and Menelaus (Paris, 1626),
  translated the Mechanics of Galileo into French (1634), wrote
  <i>Harmonicorum Libri XII</i> (1636), and <i>Cogitata
  physico-mathematica</i> (1644), and taught theology and philosophy at
  Nevers.</p>

  <p>Johann Adolph Tasse (Tassius) was born in 1585 and died at Hamburg in
  1654. He was professor of mathematics in the Gymnasium at Hamburg, and
  wrote numerous works on astronomy, chronology, statics, and elementary
  mathematics.</p>

  <p>Johann Ludwig, Baron von Wolzogen, seems to have been one of the early
  unitarians, called <i>Fratres Polonorum</i> because they took refuge in
  Poland. Some of his works appear in the <i>Bibliotheca Fratrum
  Polonorum</i> (Amsterdam, 1656). I find no one by the name who was
  contributing to mathematics at this time.</p>

  <p>Descartes is too well known to need mention in this connection.</p>

  <p>Bonaventura Cavalieri (1598-1647) was a Jesuit, a pupil of Galileo,
  and professor of mathematics at Bologna. His greatest work, <i>Geometria
  indivisibilibus continuorum nova quadam ratione promota</i>, in which he
  makes a noteworthy step towards the calculus, appeared in 1635.</p>

  <p>Jacob (Jacques) Golius was born at the Hague in 1596 and died at
  Leyden in 1667. His travels in Morocco and Asia Minor (1622-1629) gave
  him such knowledge of Arabic that he became professor of that language at
  Leyden. After Snell's death he became professor of mathematics there. He
  translated Arabic works on mathematics and astronomy into Latin.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_189" href="#NtA_189">[189]</a> It would be interesting to
  follow up these rumors, beginning perhaps with the tomb of Archimedes.
  The Ludolph van Ceulen story is very likely a myth. The one about Fagnano
  may be such. The Bernoulli tomb does have the spiral, however (such as it
  is), as any one may see in the cloisters at Basel to-day.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_190" href="#NtA_190">[190]</a> Collins (1625-1683) was
  secretary of the Royal Society, and was "a kind of register of all new
  improvements in mathematics." His office brought him into correspondence
  with all of the English scientists, and he was influential in the
  publication of various important works, including Branker's translation
  of the algebra by Rhonius, with notes by Pell, which was the first work
  to contain the present English-American symbol of division. He also
  helped in the publication of editions of Archimedes and Apollonius, of
  Kersey's Algebra, and of the works of Wallis. His profession was that of
  accountant and civil engineer, and he wrote three unimportant works on
  mathematics (one published posthumously, and the others in 1652 and
  1658).</p>

  <p>Heinrich Christian Schumacher (1780-1850) was professor of astronomy
  at Copenhagen and director of the observatory at Altona. His translation
  of Carnot's <i>Géométrie de position</i> (1807) brought him into personal
  relations with Gauss, and the friendship was helpful to Schumacher. He
  was a member of many learned societies and had a large circle of
  acquaintances. He published numerous monographs and works on
  astronomy.</p>

  <p>Gassendi (1592-1655) might well have been included by De Morgan in the
  group, since he knew and was a friend of most of the important
  mathematicians of his day. Like Mersenne, he was a minorite, but he was a
  friend of Galileo and Kepler, and wrote a work under the title
  <i>Institutio astronomica, juxta hypotheses Copernici, Tychonis-Brahaei
  et Ptolemaei</i> (1645). He taught philosophy at Aix, and was later
  professor of mathematics at the College Royal at Paris.</p>

  <p>Burnet is the Bishop Gilbert Burnet (1643-1715) who was so strongly
  anti-Romanistic that he left England during the reign of James II and
  joined the ranks of the Prince of Orange. William made him bishop of
  Salisbury.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_191" href="#NtA_191">[191]</a> There is some substantial
  basis for De Morgan's doubts as to the connection of that
  <i>mirandula</i> of his age, Sir Kenelm Digby (1603-1665), with the
  famous <i>poudre de sympathie</i>. It is true that he was just the one to
  prepare such a powder. A dilletante in everything,&mdash;learning, war,
  diplomacy, religion, letters, and science&mdash;he was the one to exploit
  a fraud of this nature. He was an astrologer, an alchemist, and a
  fabricator of tales, and well did Henry Stubbes characterize him as "the
  very Pliny of our age for lying." He first speaks of the powder in a
  lecture given at Montpellier in 1658, and in the same year he published
  the address at Paris under the title: <i>Discours fait en une célèbre
  assemblée par le chevalier Digby .... touchant la guérison de playes par
  la poudre de sympathie</i>. The London edition referred to by De Morgan
  also came out in 1658, and several editions followed it in England,
  France and Germany. But Nathaniel Highmore in his <i>History of
  Generation</i> (1651) referred to the concoction as "Talbot's Powder"
  some years before Digby took it up. The basis seems to have been vitriol,
  and it was claimed that it would heal a wound by simply being applied to
  a bandage taken from it.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_192" href="#NtA_192">[192]</a> This work by Thomas Birch
  (1705-1766) came out in 1756-57. Birch was a voluminous writer on English
  history. He was a friend of Dr. Johnson and of Walpole, and he wrote a
  life of Robert Boyle.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_193" href="#NtA_193">[193]</a> We know so much about John
  Evelyn (1620-1706) through the diary which he began at the age of eleven,
  that we forget his works on navigation and architecture.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_194" href="#NtA_194">[194]</a> I suppose this was the
  seventh Earl of Shrewsbury (1553-1616).</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_195" href="#NtA_195">[195]</a> This is interesting in view
  of the modern aseptic practice of surgery and the antiseptic treatment of
  wounds inaugurated by the late Lord Lister.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_196" href="#NtA_196">[196]</a> Perhaps De Morgan had not
  heard the <i>bon mot</i> of Dr. Holmes: "I firmly believe that if the
  whole <i>materia medica</i> could be sunk to the bottom of the sea, it
  would be all the better for mankind and all the worse for the
  fishes."</p>

  the more delight in speaking thus of Sir William Hamilton (1788-1856)
  because of a spirited controversy that they had in 1847 over the theory
  of logic. Possibly, too, Sir William's low opinion of mathematics had its
  influence.</p>

  Samuel Pepys (1633-1703) for something besides his famous diary
  (1659-1669). Not only was he president of the Royal Society (1684), but
  he was interested in establishing Sir William Boreman's mathematical
  school at Greenwich.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_219" href="#NtA_219">[219]</a> John Graunt (1620-1674) was
  a draper by trade, and was a member of the Common Council of London until
  he lost office by turning Romanist. Although a shopkeeper, he was elected
  to the Royal Society on the special recommendation of Charles II. Petty
  edited the fifth edition of his work, adding much to its size and value,
  and this may be the basis of Burnet's account of the authorship.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_220" href="#NtA_220">[220]</a> Petty (1623-1687) was a
  mathematician and economist, and a friend of Pell and Sir Charles
  Cavendish. His survey of Ireland, made for Cromwell, was one of the first
  to be made on a large scale in a scientific manner. He was one of the
  founders of the Royal Society.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_221" href="#NtA_221">[221]</a> The story probably arose
  from Graunt's recent conversion to the Roman Catholic faith.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_222" href="#NtA_222">[222]</a> He was born in 1627 and
  died in 1704. He published a series of ephemerides, beginning in 1659. He
  was imprisoned in 1679, at the time of the "Popish Plot," and again for
  treason in 1690. His important astrological works are the <i>Animal
  Cornatum, or the Horn'd Beast</i> (1654) and <i>The Nativity of the late
  King Charls</i> (1659).</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_223" href="#NtA_223">[223]</a> Isaac D'Israeli
  (1766-1848), in his <i>Curiosities of Literature</i> (1791), speaking of
  Lilly, says: "I shall observe of this egregious astronomer, that there is
  in this work, so much artless narrative, and at the same time so much
  palpable imposture, that it is difficult to know when he is speaking what
  he really believes to be the truth." He goes on to say that Lilly relates
  that "those adepts whose characters he has drawn were the lowest
  miscreants of the town. Most of them had taken the air in the pillory,
  and others had conjured themselves up to the gallows. This seems a true
  statement of facts."</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_224" href="#NtA_224">[224]</a> It is difficult to estimate
  William Lilly (1602-1681) fairly. His <i>Merlini Anglici ephemeris</i>,
  issued annually from 1642 to 1681, brought him a great deal of money. Sir
  George Wharton (1617-1681) also published an almanac annually from 1641
  to 1666. He tried to expose John Booker (1603-1677) by a work entitled
  <i>Mercurio-Coelicio-Mastix; or, an Anti-caveat to all such, as have
  (heretofore) had the misfortune to be Cheated and Deluded by that Grand
  and Traiterous Impostor of this Rebellious Age, John Booker</i>, 1644.
  Booker was "licenser of mathematical [astrological] publications," and as
  such he had quarrels with Lilly, Wharton, and others.</p>

  René Francois, Baron de Sluse (1622-1685) was canon and chancellor of
  Liège, and a member of the Royal Society. He also published a work on
  tangents (1672). The word <i>mesolabium</i> is from the Greek <span

  1667. That is, James Gregory (1638-1675) of Aberdeen (he was really born
  near but not in the city), a good Scot, was publishing his work down in
  Padua. The reason was that he had been studying in Italy, and that this
  was a product of his youth. He had already (1663) published his <i>Optica
  promota</i>, and it is not remarkable that his brilliancy brought him a
  wide circle of friends on the continent and the offer of a pension from
  Louis XIV. He became professor of mathematics at St Andrews and later at
  Edinburgh, and invented the first successful reflecting telescope. The
  distinctive feature of his <i>Vera quadratura</i> is his use of an
  infinite converging series, a plan that Archimedes used with the
  parabola.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_232" href="#NtA_232">[232]</a> Jean de Beaulieu wrote

  <i>Nouvelle invention d'arithmétique</i> (1677), and some mathematical
  tables.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_233" href="#NtA_233">[233]</a> A just estimate. There were
  several works published by Gérard Desargues (1593-1661), of which the
  greatest was the <i>Brouillon Proiect</i> (Paris, 1639). There is an
  excellent edition of the <i>&OElig;uvres de Desargues</i> by M. Poudra,

  arranging batallions and squadrons. As for the operations of this
  science, they are as follows: to add a <i>plus</i> and a <i>plus</i>, the

  that they were his own.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_242" href="#NtA_242">[242]</a> More (1614-1687) was a

  religious subjects. These were collected and published in 1805.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_244" href="#NtA_244">[244]</a> They might have been

  from one hundred to only four a year. The book to which reference is made

  the charges.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_251" href="#NtA_251">[251]</a> Valentinus was a
  Benedictine monk and was still living at Erfurt in 1413. His <i>Currus

  Ptolemaide, who died about 430. His works were printed at Paris in 1605.
  Theodor Kirckring (1640-1693) was a fellow-student of Spinoza's. Besides
  the commentary on Valentine he left several works on anatomy. His
  commentary appeared at Amsterdam in 1671. There were several editions of
  the <i>Chariot</i>.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_252" href="#NtA_252">[252]</a> The chief difficulty with

  son of "the Great Earl" (of Cork). Perhaps his best-known discovery is
  the law concerning the volume of gases.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_254" href="#NtA_254">[254]</a> The real name of Eirenaeus
  Philalethes (born in 1622) is unknown. It may have been Childe. He
  claimed to have discovered the philosopher's stone in 1645. His tract in

  <p><a name="Nt_256" href="#NtA_256">[256]</a> De Morgan should have
  written up Francis Anthony (1550-1623), whose <i>Panacea aurea sive
  tractatus duo de auro potabili</i> (Hamburg, 1619) described a panacea
  that he gave for every ill. He was repeatedly imprisoned for practicing
  medicine without a license from the Royal College of Physicians.</p>

  (1406-1490), who traveled even through Barbary, Egypt, Palestine, and
  Persia in search of the philosopher's stone. He wrote several works on
  alchemy,&mdash;<i>De Chemica</i> (1567), <i>De Chemico Miraculo</i>
  (1583), <i>Traité de la nature de l'oeuf des philosophes</i> (1659),
  etc., all published long after his death.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_258" href="#NtA_258">[258]</a> George Ripley (1415-1490)

  later a Carmelite monk. His <i>Liber de mercuris philosophico</i> and
  other tracts first appeared in <i>Opuscula quaedam chymica</i>
  (Frankfort, 1614).</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_259" href="#NtA_259">[259]</a> Besides the <i>Opus
  majus</i>, and other of the better known works of this celebrated
  Franciscan (1214-1294), there are numerous tracts on alchemy that
  appeared in the <i>Thesaurus chymicus</i> (Frankfort, 1603).</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_260" href="#NtA_260">[260]</a> George Starkey (1606-1665
  or 1666) has special interest for American readers. He seems to have been
  born in the Bermudas and to have obtained the bachelor's degree in
  England. He then went to America and in 1646 obtained the master's degree
  at Harvard, apparently under the name of Stirk. He met Eirenaeus
  Philalethes (see note <a href="#Nt_254">254</a> above) in America and
  learned alchemy from him. Returning to England, he sold quack medicines
  there, and died in 1666 from the plague after dissecting a patient who
  had died of the disease. Among his works was the <i>Liquor Alcahest, or a
  Discourse of that Immortal Dissolvent of Paracelsus and Helmont</i>,
  which appeared (1675) some nine years after his death.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_261" href="#NtA_261">[261]</a> Platt (1552-1611) was the
  son of a London brewer. Although he left a manuscript on alchemy, and
  wrote a book entitled <i>Delights for Ladies to adorne their Persons</i>
  (1607), he was knighted for some serious work on the chemistry of
  agriculture, fertilizing, brewing, and the preserving of foods, published
  in <i>The Jewell House of Art and Nature</i> (1594).</p>

  Claude François Menestrier (1631-1705), a well known historian.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_265" href="#NtA_265">[265]</a> The author was Christopher
  Nesse (1621-1705), a belligerent Calvinist, who wrote many controversial
  works and succeeded in getting excommunicated four times. One of his most
  virulent works was <i>A Protestant Antidote against the Poison of
  Popery</i>.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_266" href="#NtA_266">[266]</a> John Case (c. 1660-1700)
  was a famous astrologer and physician. He succeeded to Lilly's practice
  in London. In a darkened room, wherein he kept an array of mystical
  apparatus, he pretended to show the credulous the ghosts of their
  departed relatives. Besides his astrological works he wrote one serious
  treatise, the <i>Compendium Anatomicum nova methodo institutum</i>
  (1695), in which he defends Harvey's theories of embryology.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_267" href="#NtA_267">[267]</a> Marcelis (1636-after 1714)
  was a soap maker of Amsterdam. It is to be hoped that he made better soap
  than values of <span class="grk">&pi;</span>.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_268" href="#NtA_268">[268]</a> John Craig (died in 1731)
  was a Scotchman, but most of his life was spent at Cambridge reading and
  writing on mathematics. He endeavored to introduce the Leibnitz
  differential calculus into England. His mathematical works include the
  <i>Methodus Figurarum ... Quadraturas determinandi</i> (1685),
  <i>Tractatus ... de Figurarum Curvilinearum Quadraturis et locis
  Geometricis</i> (1693), and <i>De Calculo Fluentium libri duo</i>
  (1718).</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_269" href="#NtA_269">[269]</a> As is well known, this
  subject owes much to the Bernoullis. Craig's works on the calculus
  brought him into controversy with them. He also wrote on other subjects
  in which they were interested, as in his memoir <i>On the Curve of the
  quickest descent</i> (1700), <i>On the Solid of least resistance</i>
  (1700), and the <i>Solution of Bernoulli's problem on Curves</i>
  (1704).</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_270" href="#NtA_270">[270]</a> This is Samuel Lee
  (1783-1852), the young prodigy in languages. He was apprenticed to a
  carpenter at twelve and learned Greek while working at the trade. Before
  he was twenty-five he knew Hebrew, Chaldee, Syriac, Samaritan, Persian,
  and Hindustani. He later became Regius professor of Hebrew at
  Cambridge.</p>

  mathematics for his contributions to continued fractions.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_273" href="#NtA_273">[273]</a> Horace Walpole (1717-1797)
  published his <i>Catalogue of the Royal and Noble Authors of England</i>
  in 1758. Since his time a number of worthy names in the domain of science
  in general and of mathematics in particular might be added from the
  peerage of England.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_274" href="#NtA_274">[274]</a> It was written by Charles
  Hayes (1678-1760), a mathematician and scholar of no mean attainments. He
  travelled extensively, and was deputy governor of the Royal African
  Company. His <i>Treatise on Fluxions</i> (London, 1704) was the first
  work in English to explain Newton's calculus. He wrote a work entitled
  <i>The Moon</i> (1723) to prove that our satellite shines by its own as
  well as by reflected light. His <i>Chronographia Asiatica &amp;
  Aegyptica</i> (1758) gives the results of his travels.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_276" href="#NtA_276">[276]</a> Whiston (1667-1752)
  succeeded Newton as Lucasian professor of mathematics at Cambridge. In
  1710 he turned Arian and was expelled from the university. His work on
  <i>Primitive Christianity</i> appeared the following year. He wrote many
  works on astronomy and religion.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_277" href="#NtA_277">[277]</a> Ditton (1675-1715) was, on
  Newton's recommendation, made Head of the mathematical school at Christ's
  Hospital, London. He wrote a work on fluxions (1706). His idea for
  finding longitude at sea was to place stations in the Atlantic to fire
  off bombs at regular intervals, the time between the sound and the flash
  giving the distance. He also corresponded with Huyghens concerning the
  use of chronometers for the purpose.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_278" href="#NtA_278">[278]</a> This was John Arbuthnot (c.
  1658-1735), the mathematician, physician and wit. He was intimate with
  Pope and Swift, and was Royal physician to Queen Anne. Besides various
  satires he published a translation of Huyghens's work on probabilities

  (1727).</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_279" href="#NtA_279">[279]</a> Greene (1678-1730) was a
  very eccentric individual and was generally ridiculed by his
  contemporaries. In his will he directed that his body be dissected and
  his skeleton hung in the library of King's College, Cambridge.
  Unfortunately for his fame, this wish was never carried out.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_280" href="#NtA_280">[280]</a> This was the historian,
  Robert Sanderson (1660-1741), who spent most of his life at
  Cambridge.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_281" href="#NtA_281">[281]</a> I presume this was William
  Jones (1675-1749) the friend of Newton and Halley, vice-president of the
  Royal Society, in whose <i>Synopsis Palmariorum Matheseos</i> (1706) the
  symbol <span class="grk">&pi;</span> is first used for the circle
  ratio.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_282" href="#NtA_282">[282]</a> This was the <i>Geometrica
  solidorum, sive materiae, seu de varia compositione, progressione,
  rationeque velocitatum</i>, Cambridge, 1712. The work was parodied in
  <i>A Taste of Philosophical Fanaticism ... by a gentleman of the
  University of Gratz</i>.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_283" href="#NtA_283">[283]</a> The antiquary and scientist
  (1690-1754), president of the Royal Society, member of the Académie,
  friend of Newton, and authority on numismatics.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_284" href="#NtA_284">[284]</a> She was Catherine Barton,
  Newton's step-niece. She married John Conduitt, master of the mint, who
  collected materials for a life of Newton.</p>

  <p><i>A propos</i> of Mrs. Conduitt's life of her illustrious uncle, Sir
  George Greenhill tells a very good story on Poincaré, the well-known
  French mathematician. At an address given by the latter at the
  International Congress of Mathematicians held in Rome in 1908 he spoke of
  the story of Newton and the apple as a mere fable. After the address Sir
  George asked him why he had done so, saying that the story was first
  published by Voltaire, who had heard it from Newton's niece, Mrs.
  Conduitt. Poincaré looked blank and said, "Newton, et la nièce de Newton,
  et Voltaire,&mdash;non! je ne vous comprends pas!" He had thought Sir
  George meant Professor Volterra of Rome, whose name in French is
  Voltaire, and who could not possibly have known a niece of Newton without
  bridging a century or so.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_285" href="#NtA_285">[285]</a> This was the Edmund Turnor
  (1755-1829) who wrote the <i>Collections for the Town and Soke of

  Portsmouth's Manuscripts</i>, London, 1806.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_286" href="#NtA_286">[286]</a> It may be recalled to mind

  (Castillon, Castiglione), was born at Castiglione, in Tuscany, in 1708,
  and died at Berlin in 1791. He was professor of mathematics at Utrecht
  and at Berlin. He wrote on De Moivre's equations (1762), Cardan's rule
  (1783), and Euclid's treatment of parallels (1788-89).</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_297" href="#NtA_297">[297]</a> Palmer (1601-1647) was
  Master of Queen's College, Cambridge, a Puritan but not a separatist. His

  <p><a name="Nt_298" href="#NtA_298">[298]</a> Grosart (1827-1899) was a

  <p><a name="Nt_300" href="#NtA_300">[300]</a> Shaw (1694-1763) was
  physician extraordinary to George II. He wrote on chemistry and medicine,
  and his edition of the <i>Philosophical Works of Francis Bacon</i>
  appeared at London in 1733.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_301" href="#NtA_301">[301]</a> John Locke (1632-1704), the
  philosopher. This particular work appeared in 1695. There was an edition
  in 1834 (vol. 25 of the <i>Sacred Classics</i>) and one in 1836 (vol. 2
  of the <i>Christian Library</i>).</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_302" href="#NtA_302">[302]</a> I use the word
  <i>Socinian</i> because it was so much used in Locke's time: it is used
  in our own day by the small fry, the unlearned clergy and their immediate
  followers, as a term of reproach for <i>all</i> Unitarians. I suspect
  they have a kind of liking for the <i>word</i>; it sounds like <i>so
  sinful</i>. The learned clergy and the higher laity know better: they
  know that the bulk of the modern Unitarians go farther than Socinus, and
  are not correctly named as his followers. The Unitarians themselves
  neither desire nor deserve a name which puts them one point nearer to
  orthodoxy than they put themselves. That point is the doctrine that
  direct prayer to Jesus Christ is lawful and desirable: this Socinus held,
  and the modern Unitarians do not hold. Socinus, in treating the subject
  in his own <i>Institutio</i>, an imperfect catechism which he left, lays
  much more stress on John xiv. 13 than on xv. 16 and xvi. 23. He is not
  disinclined to think that <i>Patrem</i> should be in the first citation,
  where some put it; but he says that to ask the Father in the name of the
  Son is nothing but praying to the Son in prayer to the Father. He labors
  the point with obvious wish to secure a conclusive sanction. In the
  Racovian Catechism, of which Faustus Socinus probably drew the first
  sketch, a clearer light is arrived at. The translation says: "But wherein
  consists the divine honor due to Christ? In adoration likewise and
  invocation. For we ought at all times to adore Christ, and may in our
  necessities address our prayers to him as often as we please; and there
  are many reasons to induce us to do this freely." There are some who like
  accuracy, even in aspersion&mdash;A.&nbsp;De&nbsp;M.</p>

  <p>Socinus, or Fausto Paolo Sozzini (1539-1604), was an antitrinitarian
  who believed in prayer and homage to Christ. Leaving Italy after his
  views became known, he repaired to Basel, but his opinions were too
  extreme even for the Calvinists. He then tried Transylvania, attempting
  to convert to his views the antitrinitarian Bishop Dávid. The only result
  of his efforts was the imprisonment of Dávid and his own flight to
  Poland, in which country he spent the rest of his life (1579-1604). His
  complete works appeared first at Amsterdam in 1668, in the <i>Bibliotheca
  Fratres Polonorum</i>. The <i>Racovian Catechism</i> (1605) appeared
  after his death, but it seems to have been planned by him.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_304" href="#NtA_304">[304]</a> Edwards (1637-1716) was a
  Cambridge fellow, strongly Calvinistic. He published many theological
  works, attacking the Arminians and Socinians. Locke and Whiston were
  special objects of attack.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_307" href="#NtA_307">[307]</a> This was really very
  strange, because Laud (1573-1644), while he was Archbishop of Canterbury,
  forced a good deal of High Church ritual on the Puritan clergy, and even
  wished to compel the use of a prayer book in Scotland. It was this
  intolerance that led to his impeachment and execution.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_308" href="#NtA_308">[308]</a> The name is Jonchère. He
  was a man of some merit, proposing (1718) an important canal in Burgundy,
  and publishing a work on the <i>Découverte des longitudes estimées
  généralement impossible à trouver</i>, 1734 (or 1735).</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_309" href="#NtA_309">[309]</a> Locke invented a kind of an
  instrument for finding longitude, and it is described in the appendix,
  but I can find nothing about the man. There was published some years
  later (London, 1751) another work of his, <i>A new Problem to discover
  the longitude at sea</i>.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_310" href="#NtA_310">[310]</a> Baxter, concerning whom I

  <p><a name="Nt_311" href="#NtA_311">[311]</a> John, who died in 1780, was
  a well-known character in his way. He was a bookseller on Fleet Street,
  and his shop was a general rendezvous for the literary men of his time.
  He wrote the <i>Memoirs of the Life and Writings of Mr. William
  Whiston</i> (1749, with another edition in 1753). He was one of the first
  to issue regular catalogues of books with prices affixed.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_312" href="#NtA_312">[312]</a> The name appears both as
  Hulls and as Hull. He was born in Gloucestershire in 1699. In 1754 he
  published <i>The Art of Measuring made Easy by the help of a new Sliding
  Scale</i>.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_313" href="#NtA_313">[313]</a> Thomas Newcomen (1663-1729)
  invented the first practical steam engine about 1710. It was of about
  five and a half horse power, and was used for pumping water from coal
  mines. Savery had described such an engine in 1702, but Newcomen improved
  upon it and made it practical.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_314" href="#NtA_314">[314]</a> The well-known benefactor
  of art (1787-1863).</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_315" href="#NtA_315">[315]</a> The tract was again

  <p><a name="Nt_316" href="#NtA_316">[316]</a> Hulls made his experiment
  on the Avon, at Evesham, in 1737, having patented his machine in 1736. He
  had a Newcomen engine connected with six paddles. This was placed in the
  front of a small tow boat. The experiment was a failure.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_317" href="#NtA_317">[317]</a> William Symington
  (1763-1831). In 1786 he <span class="correction" title="text reads `contructed'"
  >constructed</span> a working model of a steam road carriage. The
  machinery was applied to a small boat in 1788, and with such success as
  to be tried on a larger boat in 1789. The machinery was clumsy, however,
  and in 1801 he took out a new patent for the style of engine still used
  on paddle wheel steamers. This engine was successfully used in 1802, on
  the Charlotte Dundas. Fulton (1765-1815) was on board, and so impressed
  Robert Livingston with the idea that the latter furnished the money to
  build the Clermont (1807), the beginning of successful river
  navigation.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_318" href="#NtA_318">[318]</a> Louis Bertrand Castel
  (1688-1757), most of whose life was spent in trying to perfect his
  <i>Clavecin oculaire</i>, an instrument on the order of the harpsichord,
  intended to produce melodies and harmonies of color. He also wrote
  <i>L'Optique des couleurs</i> (1740) and <i>Sur le fond de la Musique</i>
  (1754).</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_319" href="#NtA_319">[319]</a> Dr. Robinson (1680-1754)
  was professor of physic at Trinity College, Dublin, and three times
  president of King and Queen's College of Physicians. In his <i>Treatise

  anticipated the discoveries of Lavoisier and Priestley on the nature of
  oxygen.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_320" href="#NtA_320">[320]</a> There was another edition,
  published at London in 1747, 8vo.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_329" href="#NtA_329">[329]</a> Dr. Knight (died in 1772)
  made some worthy contributions to the literature of the mariner's

  <p><a name="Nt_330" href="#NtA_330">[330]</a> Sir Anthony Panizzi
  (1797-1879) fled from Italy under sentence of death (1822). He became
  assistant (1831) and chief (1856) librarian of the British Museum, and
  was knighted in 1869. He began the catalogue of printed books of the
  Museum.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_331" href="#NtA_331">[331]</a> Wright (1711-1786) was a
  physicist. He was offered the professorship of mathematics at the
  Imperial Academy of St. Petersburg but declined to accept it. This work
  is devoted chiefly to the theory of the Milky Way, the <i>via lactea</i>
  as he calls it after the manner of the older writers.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_332" href="#NtA_332">[332]</a> Troughton (1753-1835) was
  one of the world's greatest instrument makers. He was apprenticed to his
  brother John, and the two succeeded (1770) Wright and Cole in Fleet
  Street. Airy called his method of graduating circles the greatest
  improvement ever made in instrument making. He constructed (1800) the
  first modern transit circle, and his instruments were used in many of the
  chief observatories of the world.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_333" href="#NtA_333">[333]</a> William Simms (1793-1860)
  was taken into partnership by Troughton (1826) after the death of the
  latter's brother. The firm manufactured some well-known instruments.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_334" href="#NtA_334">[334]</a> This was George Horne
  (1730-1792), fellow of Magdalen College, Oxford, vice-Chancellor of the
  University (1776), Dean of Canterbury (1781), and Bishop of Norwich
  (1790). He was a great satirist, but most of his pamphlets against men
  like Adam Smith, Swedenborg, and Hume, were anonymous, as in the case of
  this one against Newton. He was so liberal in his attitude towards the
  Methodists that he would not have John Wesley forbidden to preach in his
  diocese. He was twenty-one when this tract appeared.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_335" href="#NtA_335">[335]</a> Martin (1704-1782) was by
  no means "old Benjamin Martin" when Horne wrote this pamphlet in 1749. In
  fact he was then only forty-five. He was a physicist and a well-known
  writer on scientific instruments. He also wrote <i>Philosophia Britannica
  or a new and comprehensive system of the Newtonian Philosophy</i>
  (1759).</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_336" href="#NtA_336">[336]</a> Jean Théophile Desaguliers,
  or Des Aguliers (1683-1744) was the son of a Protestant who left France
  after the revocation of the Edict of Nantes. He became professor of
  physics at Oxford, and afterwards gave lectures in London. Later he
  became chaplain to the Prince of Wales. He published several works on
  physics.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_337" href="#NtA_337">[337]</a> Charles Hutton (1737-1823),
  professor of mathematics at Woolwich (1772-1807). His <i>Mathematical
  Tables</i> (1785) and <i>Mathematical and Philosophical Dictionary</i>
  (1795-1796) are well known.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_338" href="#NtA_338">[338]</a> James Epps (1773-1839)
  contributed a number of memoirs on the use and corrections of
  instruments. He was assistant secretary of the Astronomical Society.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_339" href="#NtA_339">[339]</a> John Hutchinson (1674-1737)
  was one of the first to try to reconcile the new science of geology with
  Genesis. He denied the Newtonian hypothesis as dangerous to religion, and
  because it necessitated a vacuum. He was a mystic in his interpretation
  of the Scriptures, and created a sect that went under the name of
  Hutchinsonians.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_340" href="#NtA_340">[340]</a> John Rowning, a
  Lincolnshire rector, died in 1771. He wrote on physics, and published a
  memoir on <i>A machine for finding the roots of equations universally</i>
  (1770).</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_341" href="#NtA_341">[341]</a> It is always difficult to
  sanction this spelling of the name of this Jesuit father who is so often
  mentioned in the analytic treatment of conics. He was born in Ragusa in
  1711, and the original spelling was Ru&#x111;er Josip
  Bo&#x161;kovi&#x107;. When he went to live in Italy, as professor of
  mathematics at Rome (1740) and at Pavia, the name was spelled Ruggiero
  Giuseppe Boscovich, although Boscovicci would seem to a foreigner more
  natural. His astronomical work was notable, and in his <i>De maculis
  solaribus</i> (1736) there is the first determination of the equator of a
  planet by observing the motion of spots on its surface. Boscovich came
  near having some contact with America, for he was delegated to observe in
  California the transit of Venus in 1755, being prevented by the
  dissolution of his order just at that time. He died in 1787, at
  Milan.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_342" href="#NtA_342">[342]</a> James Granger (1723-1776)

  thousand.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_343" href="#NtA_343">[343]</a> He was curator of
  experiments for the Royal Society. He wrote a large number of books and
  monographs on physics. He died about 1713.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_347" href="#NtA_347">[347]</a> Joseph Jérome le François
  de Lalande (1732-1807), professor of astronomy in the Collège de France
  (1753) and director of the Paris Observatory (1761). His writings on
  astronomy and his <i>Bibliographie astronomique, avec l'histoire de
  l'astronomie depuis 1781 jusqu'en 1802</i> (Paris, 1803) are well
  known.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_348" href="#NtA_348">[348]</a> De Morgan refers to his
  <i>Histoire de l'Astronomie au 18e siècle</i>, which appeared in 1827,
  five years after Delambre's death. Jean Baptiste Joseph Delambre
  (1749-1822) was a pupil of and a collaborator with Lalande, following his
  master as professor of astronomy in the Collège de France. His work on
  the measurements for the metric system is well known, and his four
  histories of astronomy, <i>ancienne</i> (1817), <i>au moyen âge</i>
  (1819), <i>moderne</i> (1821), and <i>au 18e siècle</i> (posthumous,
  1827) are highly esteemed.</p>

  calling the kettle black; for while he was a brilliant writer he was a
  careless bibliographer.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_350" href="#NtA_350">[350]</a> Isaac Barrow (1630-1677)

  <p><a name="Nt_351" href="#NtA_351">[351]</a> "Besides we can see by this
  that Barrow was a poor philosopher; for he believed in the immortality of

  mathématiques et physiques</i> (Paris, 1694) of Jacques Ozanam
  (1640-1717) is a work that is still highly esteemed. Among various other
  works he wrote a <i>Dictionnaire mathématique ou Idée générale des
  mathématiques</i> (1690) that was not without merit. The
  <i>Récréations</i> went through numerous editions (Paris, 1694, 1696,
  1741, 1750, 1770, 1778, and the Montucla edition of 1790; London, 1708,
  the Montucla-Hutton edition of 1803 and the Riddle edition of 1840;
  Dublin, 1790).</p>

  college at Bar, and professor of philosophy and mathematics. He wrote on
  astronomy (1619) and horology (1616), and is known for his <i>Selecta
  Propositiones in tota sparsim mathematica pulcherrime propositae in
  solemni festo SS. Ignatii et Francesci Xaverii</i>, 1622. The book to
  which De Morgan refers is his <i>Récréation mathématicque, composée de
  plusieurs problèmes plaisants et facetieux</i>, Lyons, 1627, with an
  edition at Pont-à-Mousson, 1629. There were English editions published at
  London in 1633, 1653, and 1674, and Dutch editions in 1662 and 1672.</p>

  <p>I do not understand how De Morgan happened to miss owning the work by
  Claude Gaspar Bachet de Meziriac (1581-1638), <i>Problèmes plaisans et
  délectables</i>, which appeared at Lyons in 1612, 8vo, with a second
  edition in 1624. There was a fifth edition published at Paris in
  1884.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_354" href="#NtA_354">[354]</a> His title page closes with
  "Paris, Chez Ch. Ant. Jombert.... M DCC LIV."</p>

  <p>This was Charles-Antoine Jombert (1712-1784), a printer and bookseller
  with some taste for painting and architecture. He wrote several works and
  edited a number of early treatises.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_355" href="#NtA_355">[355]</a> The late Professor Newcomb
  made the matter plain even to the non-mathematical mind, when he said
  that "ten decimal places are sufficient to give the circumference of the
  earth to the fraction of an inch, and thirty decimal places would give
  the circumference of the whole visible universe to a quantity
  imperceptible with the most powerful microscope."</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_357" href="#NtA_357">[357]</a> Celestino Cominale
  (1722-1785) was professor of medicine at the University of Naples.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_358" href="#NtA_358">[358]</a> The work appeared in the
  years from 1844 to 1849.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_359" href="#NtA_359">[359]</a> There was a Vienna edition
  in 1758, 4to, and another in 1759, 4to. This edition is described on the
  title page as <i>Editio Veneta prima ipso auctore praesente, et
  corrigente</i>.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_360" href="#NtA_360">[360]</a> The first edition was
  entitled <i>De solis ac lunae defectibus libri V.&nbsp;P. Rogerii Josephi
  Boscovich ... cum ejusdem auctoris adnotationibus</i>, London, 1760. It
  also appeared in Venice in 1761, and in French translation by the Abbé de
  Baruel in 1779, and was a work of considerable influence.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_361" href="#NtA_361">[361]</a> Paulian (1722-1802) was
  professor of physics at the Jesuit college at Avignon. He wrote several
  works, the most popular of which, the <i>Dictionnaire de physique</i>
  (Avignon, 1761), went through nine editions by 1789.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_362" href="#NtA_362">[362]</a> This is correct.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_363" href="#NtA_363">[363]</a> Probably referring to the
  fact that Hill (1795-1879), who had done so much for postal reform, was
  secretary to the postmaster general (1846), and his name was a synonym
  for the post office directory.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_364" href="#NtA_364">[364]</a> Richard Lovett (1692-1780)
  was a good deal of a charlatan. He claimed to have studied electrical
  phenomena, and in 1758 advertised that he could effect marvelous cures,
  especially of sore throat, by means of electricity. Before publishing the
  works mentioned by De Morgan he had issued others of similar character,
  including <i>The Subtile Medium proved</i> (London, 1756) and <i>The
  Reviewers Reviewed</i> (London, 1760).</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_365" href="#NtA_365">[365]</a> Jean Sylvain Bailly
  (1736-1793), member of the <i>Académie française</i> and of the
  <i>Académie des sciences</i>, first deputy elected to represent Paris in
  the <i>Etats-généraux</i> (1789), president of the first National
  Assembly, and mayor of Paris (1789-1791). For his vigor as mayor in
  keeping the peace, and for his manly defence of the Queen, he was
  guillotined. He was an astronomer of ability, but is best known for his
  histories of the science.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_366" href="#NtA_366">[366]</a> These were the <i>Histoire
  de l'Astronomie ancienne</i> (1775), <i>Histoire de l'Astronomie
  moderne</i> (1778-1783), <i>Histoire de l'Astronomie indienne et
  orientale</i> (1787), and <i>Lettres sur l'origine des peuples de
  l'Asie</i> (1775).</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_367" href="#NtA_367">[367]</a> "The sick old man of
  Ferney, V., a boy of a hundred years." Voltaire was born in 1694, and
  hence was eighty-three at this time.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_368" href="#NtA_368">[368]</a> In Palmézeaux's <i>Vie de
  Bailly</i>, in Bailly's <i>Ouvrage Posthume</i> (1810), M. de Sales is
  quoted as saying that the <i>Lettres sur l'Atlantide</i> were sent to
  Voltaire and that the latter did not approve of the theory set forth.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_369" href="#NtA_369">[369]</a> The British Museum
  catalogue gives two editions, 1781 and 1782.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_370" href="#NtA_370">[370]</a> A mystic and a
  spiritualist. His chief work was the one mentioned here.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_371" href="#NtA_371">[371]</a> Jacob Behmen, or Böhme
  (1575-1624), known as "the German theosophist," was founder of the sect
  of Boehmists, a cult allied to the Swedenborgians. He was given to the
  study of alchemy, and brought the vocabulary of the science into his
  mystic writings. His sect was revived in England in the eighteenth
  century through the efforts of William Law. Saint-Martin translated into
  French two of his Latin works under the titles <i>L'Aurore naissante, ou
  la Racine de la philosophie</i> (1800), and <i>Les trois principes de
  l'essence divine</i> (1802). The originals had appeared nearly two
  hundred years earlier,&mdash;<i>Aurora</i> in 1612, and <i>De tribus
  principiis</i> in 1619.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_372" href="#NtA_372">[372]</a> "Unknown."</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_373" href="#NtA_373">[373]</a> "Skeptical."</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_374" href="#NtA_374">[374]</a> "Man, man, man."</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_375" href="#NtA_375">[375]</a> "Men, men, men."</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_376" href="#NtA_376">[376]</a> It is interesting to read
  De Morgan's argument against Saint-Martin's authorship of this work. It
  is attributed to Saint-Martin both by the <i>Biographie Universelle</i>
  and by the <i>British Museum Catalogue</i>, and De Morgan says by
  "various catalogues and biographies."</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_377" href="#NtA_377">[377]</a> "To explain things by man
  and not man by things. <i>On Errors and Truth</i>, by a Ph....
  Inc...."</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_378" href="#NtA_378">[378]</a> "If we would preserve
  ourselves from all illusions, and above all from the allurements of
  pride, by which man is so often seduced, we should never take man, but
  always God, for our term of comparison."</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_379" href="#NtA_379">[379]</a> "And here is found already
  an explanation of the numbers four and nine which caused some perplexity
  in the work cited above. Man is lost in passing from four to nine."</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_380" href="#NtA_380">[380]</a> Williams also took part in
  the preparation of some tables for the government to assist in the
  determination of longitude. He had published a work two years before the
  one here cited, on the same subject,&mdash;<i>An entire new work and
  method to discover the variation of the Earth's <span class="correction"
  title="text reads `Diaameters'">Diameters</span></i>, London, 1786.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_381" href="#NtA_381">[381]</a> This is Gabriel Mouton
  (1618-1694), a vicar at Lyons, who suggested as a basis for a natural
  system of measures the <i>mille</i>, a minute of a degree of the
  meridian. This appeared in his <i>Observationes diametrorum solis et
  lunae apparentium, meridianarumque aliquot altitudinum cum tabula
  declinationum solis</i>.... Lyons, 1670.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_382" href="#NtA_382">[382]</a> Jacques Cassini
  (1677-1756), one of the celebrated Cassini family of astronomers. After
  the death of his father he became director of the observatory at Paris.
  The basis for a metric unit was set forth by him in his <i>Traité de la
  grandeur et de la figure de la terre</i>, Paris, 1720. He was a prolific
  writer on astronomy.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_383" href="#NtA_383">[383]</a> Alexis Jean Pierre Paucton
  (1732-1798). He was, for a time, professor of mathematics at Strassburg,
  but later (1796) held office in Paris. His leading contribution to
  metrology was his <i>Métrologie ou Traité des mesures</i>, Paris,
  1780.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_384" href="#NtA_384">[384]</a> He was an obscure writer,
  born at Deptford.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_385" href="#NtA_385">[385]</a> He was also a writer of no
  scientific merit, his chief contributions being religious tracts. One of
  his productions, however, went through many editions, even being
  translated into French; <i>Three dialogues between a Minister and one of
  his Parishioners; on the true principles of Religion and salvation for
  sinners by Jesus Christ</i>. The twentieth edition appeared at Cambridge
  in 1786.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_386" href="#NtA_386">[386]</a> This was the <i>Reflections
  on the Revolution in France, and on the proceedings in certain societies
  in London relative to that event</i> (London, 1790) by Edmund Burke
  (1729-1797). Eleven editions of the work appeared the first year.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_387" href="#NtA_387">[387]</a> Paine (1736-1809) was born
  in Norfolkshire, of Quaker parents. He went to America at the beginning
  of the Revolution and published, in January 1776, a violent pamphlet
  entitled <i>Common Sense</i>. He was a private soldier under Washington,
  and on his return to England after the war he published <i>The Rights of
  Man</i>. He was indicted for treason and was outlawed to France. He was
  elected to represent Calais at the French convention, but his plea for
  moderation led him perilously near the guillotine. His <i>Age of
  Reason</i> (1794) was dedicated to Washington. He returned to America in
  1802 and remained there until his death.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_388" href="#NtA_388">[388]</a> Part I appeared in 1791 and
  was so popular that eight editions appeared in that year. It was followed
  in 1792 by Part II, of which nine editions appeared in that year. Both
  parts were immediately republished in Paris, and there have been several
  subsequent editions.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_389" href="#NtA_389">[389]</a> Mary Wollstonecraft
  (1759-1797) was only thirty-three when this work came out. She had
  already published <i>An historical and moral View of the Origin and
  Progress of the French Revolution</i> (1790), and <i>Original Stories
  from Real Life</i> (1791). She went to Paris in 1792 and remained during
  the Reign of Terror.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_390" href="#NtA_390">[390]</a> Samuel Parr (1747-1827) was
  for a time head assistant at Harrow (1767-1771), afterwards headmaster in
  other schools. At the time this book was written he was vicar of Hatton,
  where he took private pupils (1785-1798) to the strictly limited number
  of seven. He was a violent Whig and a caustic writer.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_391" href="#NtA_391">[391]</a> On Mary Wollstonecraft's
  return from France she married (1797) William Godwin (1756-1836). He had
  started as a strong Calvinistic Nonconformist minister, but had become
  what would now be called an anarchist, at least by conservatives. He had
  written an <i>Inquiry concerning Political Justice</i> (1793) and a novel
  entitled <i>Caleb Williams, or Things as they are</i> (1794), both of
  which were of a nature to attract his future wife.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_392" href="#NtA_392">[392]</a> This child was a daughter.
  She became Shelley's wife, and Godwin's influence on Shelley was very
  marked.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_393" href="#NtA_393">[393]</a> This was John Nichols
  (1745-1826), the publisher and antiquary. He edited the <i>Gentleman's
  Magazine</i> (1792-1826) and his works include the <i>Literary Anecdotes
  of the Eighteenth Century</i> (1812-1815), to which De Morgan here
  refers.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_394" href="#NtA_394">[394]</a> William Bellenden, a Scotch
  professor at the University of Paris, who died about 1633. His textbooks
  are now forgotten, but Parr edited an edition of his works in 1787. The
  Latin preface, <i>Praefatio ad Bellendum de Statu</i>, was addressed to
  Burke, North, and Fox, and was a satire on their political opponents.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_395" href="#NtA_395">[395]</a> As we have seen, he had
  been head-master before he began taking "his handful of private
  pupils."</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_396" href="#NtA_396">[396]</a> The story has evidently got
  mixed up in the telling, for Tom Sheridan (1721-1788), the great actor,
  was old enough to have been Dr. Parr's father. It was his son, Richard
  Brinsley Sheridan (1751-1816), the dramatist and politician, who was the
  pupil of Parr. He wrote <i>The Rivals</i> (1775) and <i>The School for
  Scandal</i> (1777) soon after Parr left Harrow.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_397" href="#NtA_397">[397]</a> Horner (1785-1864) was a
  geologist and social reformer. He was very influential in improving the
  conditions of child labor.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_398" href="#NtA_398">[398]</a> William Cobbett
  (1762-1835), the journalist, was a character not without interest to
  Americans. Born in Surrey, he went to America at the age of thirty and
  remained there eight years. Most of this time he was occupied as a
  bookseller in Philadelphia, and while thus engaged he was fined for libel
  against the celebrated Dr. Rush. On his return to England he edited the
  <i>Weekly Political Register</i> (1802-1835), a popular journal among the
  working classes. He was fined and imprisoned for two years because of his
  attack (1810) on military flogging, and was also (1831) prosecuted for
  sedition. He further showed his paradox nature by his <i>History of the
  Protestant Reformation</i> (1824-1827), an attack on the prevailing
  Protestant opinion. He also wrote a <i>Life of Andrew Jackson</i> (1834).
  After repeated attempts he succeeded in entering parliament, a result of
  the Reform Bill.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_399" href="#NtA_399">[399]</a> Robinson (1735-1790) was a
  Baptist minister who wrote several theological works and a number of
  hymns. His work at Cambridge so offended the students that they at one
  time broke up the services.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_400" href="#NtA_400">[400]</a> This work had passed
  through twelve editions by 1823.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_401" href="#NtA_401">[401]</a> Dyer (1755-1841), the poet
  and reformer, edited Robinson's <i>Ecclesiastical Researches</i> (1790).
  He was a life-long friend of Charles Lamb, and in their boyhood they were
  schoolmates at Christ's Hospital. His <i>Complaints of the Poor People of
  England</i> (1793) made him a worthy companion of the paradoxers above
  mentioned.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_402" href="#NtA_402">[402]</a> These were John Thelwall
  (1764-1834) whose <i>Politics for the People or Hogswash</i> (1794) took
  its title from the fact that Burke called the people the "swinish
  multitude." The book resulted in sending the author to the Tower for
  sedition. In 1798 he gave up politics and started a school of elocution
  which became very famous. Thomas Hardy (1752-1832), who kept a
  bootmaker's shop in Piccadilly, was a fellow prisoner with Thelwall,
  being arrested for high treason. He was founder (1792) of The London
  Corresponding Society, a kind of clearing house for radical associations
  throughout the country. Horne Tooke was really John Horne (1736-1812), he
  having taken the name of his friend William Tooke in 1782. He was a
  radical of the radicals, and organized a number of reform societies.
  Among these was the Constitutional Society that voted money (1775) to
  assist the American revolutionists, appointing him to give the
  contribution to Franklin. For this he was imprisoned for a year. With his
  fellow rebels in the Tower in 1794, however, he was acquitted. As a
  philologist he is known for his early advocacy of the study of
  Anglo-Saxon and Gothic, and his <i>Diversions of Purley</i> (1786) is
  still known to readers.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_403" href="#NtA_403">[403]</a> This was the admiral, Adam
  Viscount Duncan (1731-1804), who defeated the Dutch off Camperdown in
  1797.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_404" href="#NtA_404">[404]</a> He was created Duke of
  Clarence and St. Andrews in 1789 and was Admiral of the Fleet escorting
  Louis XVIII on his return to France in 1814. He became Lord High Admiral
  in 1827, and reigned as William IV from 1830 to 1837.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_405" href="#NtA_405">[405]</a> This was Charles Abbott
  (1762-1832) first Lord Tenterden. He succeeded Lord Ellenborough as Chief
  Justice (1818) and was raised to the peerage in 1827. He was a strong
  Tory and opposed the Catholic Relief Bill, the Reform Bill, and the
  abolition of the death penalty for forgery. </p>

  <p><a name="Nt_406" href="#NtA_406">[406]</a> Edward Law (1750-1818),
  first Baron Ellenborough. He was chief counsel for Warren Hastings, and
  his famous speech in defense of his client is well known. He became Chief
  Justice and was raised to the peerage in 1802. He opposed all efforts to
  modernize the criminal code, insisting upon the reactionary principle of
  new death penalties. </p>

  <p><a name="Nt_407" href="#NtA_407">[407]</a> Edmund Law (1703-1787),
  Bishop of Carlisle (1768), was a good deal more liberal than his son. His
  <i>Considerations on the Propriety of requiring subscription to the
  Articles of Faith</i> (1774) was published anonymously. In it he asserts
  that not even the clergy should be required to subscribe to the
  thirty-nine articles.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_408" href="#NtA_408">[408]</a> Joe Miller (1684-1738), the
  famous Drury Lane comedian, was so illiterate that he could not have
  written the <i>Joe Miller's Jests, or the Wit's Vade-Mecum</i> that
  appeared the year after his death. It was often reprinted and probably
  contained more or less of Miller's own jokes.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_409" href="#NtA_409">[409]</a> The sixth duke (1766-1839)
  was much interested in parliamentary reform. He was a member of the
  Society of Friends of the People. He was for fourteen years a member of
  parliament (1788-1802) and was later Lord Lieutenant of Ireland
  (1806-1807). He afterwards gave up politics and became interested in
  agricultural matters.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_410" href="#NtA_410">[410]</a> George Jeffreys (c.
  1648-1689), the favorite of James II, who was active in prosecuting the
  Rye House conspirators. He was raised to the peerage in 1684 and held the
  famous "bloody assize" in the following year, being made Lord Chancellor
  as a result. He was imprisoned in the Tower by William III and died
  there.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_411" href="#NtA_411">[411]</a> <i>The Every Day Book,
  forming a Complete History of the Year, Months, and Seasons, and a
  perpetual Key to the Almanack</i>, 1826-1827.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_412" href="#NtA_412">[412]</a> The first and second
  editions appeared in 1820. Two others followed in 1821.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_413" href="#NtA_413">[413]</a> <i>The three trials of W.
  H., for publishing three parodies; viz the late John Wilkes' Catechism,
  the Political Litany, and the Sinecurists Creed; on three ex-officio
  informations, at Guildhall, London, ... Dec. 18, 19, &amp; 20,
  1817</i>,... London, 1818.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_414" href="#NtA_414">[414]</a> The <i>Political Litany</i>
  appeared in 1817.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_415" href="#NtA_415">[415]</a> That is, Castlereagh's.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_416" href="#NtA_416">[416]</a> The well-known caricaturist
  (1792-1878), then only twenty-nine years old.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_417" href="#NtA_417">[417]</a> Robert Stewart (1769-1822)
  was second Marquis of Londonderry and Viscount Castlereagh. As Chief
  Secretary for Ireland he was largely instrumental in bringing about the
  union of Ireland and Great Britain. He was at the head of the war
  department during most of the Napoleonic wars, and was to a great extent
  responsible for the European coalition against the Emperor. He suicided
  in 1822.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_418" href="#NtA_418">[418]</a> John Murray (1778-1843),
  the well-known London publisher. He refused to finish the publication of
  Don Juan, after the first five cantos, because of his Tory
  principles.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_419" href="#NtA_419">[419]</a> Only the first two cantos
  appeared in 1819.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_420" href="#NtA_420">[420]</a> Proclus (412-485), one of
  the greatest of the neo-Platonists, studied at Alexandria and taught
  philosophy at Athens. He left commentaries on Plato and on part of
  Euclid's <i>Elements</i>.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_421" href="#NtA_421">[421]</a> Thomas Taylor (1758-1835),
  called "the Platonist," had a liking for mathematics, and was probably
  led by his interest in number mysticism to a study of neo-Platonism. He
  translated a number of works from the Latin and Greek, and wrote two
  works on theoretical arithmetic (1816, 1823).</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_422" href="#NtA_422">[422]</a> There was an earlier
  edition, 1788-89.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_423" href="#NtA_423">[423]</a> Georgius Gemistus, or
  Georgius Pletho (Plethon), lived in the fourteenth and fifteenth
  centuries. He was a native of Constantinople, but spent most of his time
  in Greece. He devoted much time to the propagation of the Platonic
  philosophy, but also wrote on divinity, geography, and history.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_424" href="#NtA_424">[424]</a> Hannah More (1745-1833),
  was, in her younger days, a friend of Burke, Reynolds, Dr. Johnson, and
  Garrick. At this time she wrote a number of poems and aspired to become a
  dramatist. Her <i>Percy</i> (1777), with a prologue and epilogue by
  Garrick, had a long run at Covent Garden. Somewhat later she came to
  believe that the playhouse was a grave public evil, and refused to attend
  the revival of her own play with Mrs. Siddons in the leading part. After
  1789 she and her sisters devoted themselves to starting schools for poor
  children, teaching them religion and housework, but leaving them
  illiterate.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_425" href="#NtA_425">[425]</a> These were issued at the
  rate of three each month,&mdash;a story, a ballad, and a Sunday tract.
  They were collected and published in one volume in 1795. It is said that
  two million copies were sold the first year. There were also editions in
  1798, 1819, 1827, and 1836-37.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_426" href="#NtA_426">[426]</a> That is, Dr. Johnson

  imitation of Addison's <i>Spectator</i>.</p>

  below.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_428" href="#NtA_428">[428]</a> Dr. John Moore (1729-1802),
  physician and novelist, is now best known for his <i>Journal during a
  Residence in France from the beginning of August to the middle of
  December, 1792</i>, a work quoted frequently by Carlyle in his <i>French
  Revolution</i>.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_429" href="#NtA_429">[429]</a> Sir John Moore (1761-1809),
  Lieutenant General in the Napoleonic wars. He was killed in the battle of
  Corunna. The poem by Charles Wolfe (1791-1823), <i>The Burial of Sir John
  Moore</i> (1817), is well known.</p>

  Stuart Mill.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_431" href="#NtA_431">[431]</a> Frances Burney, Madame
  d'Arblay (1752-1840), married General d'Arblay, a French officer and
  companion of Lafayette, in 1793. She was only twenty-five when she
  acquired fame by her <i>Evelina, or a Young Lady's Entrance into the
  World</i>. Her <i>Letters and Diaries</i> appeared posthumously
  (1842-45).</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_432" href="#NtA_432">[432]</a> Henry Peter, Baron Brougham
  and Vaux (1778-1868), well known in politics, science, and letters. He
  was one of the founders of the <i>Edinburgh Review</i>, became Lord
  Chancellor in 1830, and took part with men like William Frend, De
  Morgan's father-in-law, in the establishing of London University. He was
  also one of the founders of the Society for the Diffusion of Useful
  Knowledge. He was always friendly to De Morgan, who entered the faculty
  of London University, whose work on geometry was published by the Society
  mentioned, and who was offered the degree of doctor of laws by the
  University of Edinburgh while Lord Brougham was Lord Rector. The
  Edinburgh honor was refused by De Morgan who said he "did not feel like
  an LL.D."</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_433" href="#NtA_433">[433]</a> Maria Edgeworth
  (1767-1849).</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_434" href="#NtA_434">[434]</a> Sydney Owenson (c.
  1783-1859) married Sir Thomas Morgan, a well-known surgeon, in 1812. Her
  Irish stories were very popular with the patriots but were attacked by
  the <i>Quarterly Review</i>. <i>The Wild Irish Girl</i> (1806) went
  through seven editions in two years.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_435" href="#NtA_435">[435]</a> 1775-1817.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_436" href="#NtA_436">[436]</a> 1771-1832.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_437" href="#NtA_437">[437]</a> The famous preacher
  (1732-1808). He was the first chairman of the Religious Tract Society. He
  is also known as one of the earliest advocates of vaccination, in his
  <i>Cow-pock Inoculation vindicated and recommended from matters of
  fact</i>, 1806.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_438" href="#NtA_438">[438]</a> Sir Rowland Hill
  (1795-1879), the father of penny postage.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_439" href="#NtA_439">[439]</a> Beilby Porteus (1731-1808),
  Bishop of Chester (1776) and Bishop of London (1787). He encouraged the
  Sunday-school movement and the dissemination of Hannah More's tracts. He
  was an active opponent of slavery, but also of Catholic emancipation.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_440" href="#NtA_440">[440]</a> Henrietta Maria Bowdler
  (1754-1830), generally known as Mrs. Harriet Bowdler. She was the author
  of many religious tracts and poems. Her <i>Poems and Essays</i> (1786)
  were often reprinted. The story goes that on the appearance of her
  <i>Sermons on the Doctrines and duties of Christianity</i> (published
  anonymously), Bishop Porteus offered the author a living under the
  impression that it was written by a man.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_441" href="#NtA_441">[441]</a> William Frend (1757-1841),
  whose daughter Sophia Elizabeth became De Morgan's wife (1837), was at
  one time a clergyman of the Established Church, but was converted to
  Unitarianism (1787). He came under De Morgan's definition of a true
  paradoxer, carrying on a zealous warfare for what he thought right. As a
  result of his <i>Address to the Inhabitants of Cambridge</i> (1787), and
  his efforts to have abrogated the requirement that candidates for the
  M.A. must subscribe to the thirty-nine articles, he was deprived of his
  tutorship in 1788. A little later he was banished (see De Morgan's
  statement in the text) from Cambridge because of his denunciation of the
  abuses of the Church and his condemnation of the liturgy. His
  eccentricity is seen in his declining to use negative quantities in the
  operations of algebra. He finally became an actuary at London and was
  prominent in radical associations. He was a mathematician of ability,
  having been second wrangler and having nearly attained the first place,
  and he was also an excellent scholar in Latin, Greek, and Hebrew.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_442" href="#NtA_442">[442]</a> George Peacock (1791-1858),
  Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge, Lowndean professor of astronomy,
  and Dean of Ely Cathedral (1839). His tomb may be seen at Ely where he
  spent the latter part of his life. He was one of the group that
  introduced the modern continental notation of the calculus into England,
  replacing the cumbersome notation of Newton, passing from "the
  <i>dot</i>age of fluxions to the <i>de</i>ism of the calculus."</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_443" href="#NtA_443">[443]</a> Robert Simson (1687-1768);
  professor of mathematics at Glasgow. His restoration of Apollonius (1749)
  and his translation and restoration of Euclid (1756, and
  1776&mdash;posthumous) are well known.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_444" href="#NtA_444">[444]</a> Francis Maseres
  (1731-1824), a prominent lawyer. His mathematical works had some
  merit.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_447" href="#NtA_447">[447]</a> John Singleton Copley,
  Baron Lyndhurst (1772-1863), the son of John Singleton Copley the
  portrait painter, was born in Boston. He was educated at Trinity College,
  Cambridge, and became a lawyer. He was made Lord Chancellor in 1827.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_448" href="#NtA_448">[448]</a> Sir William Rough (c.
  1772-1838), a lawyer and poet, became Chief Justice of Ceylon in 1836. He
  was knighted in 1837.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_449" href="#NtA_449">[449]</a> Herbert Marsh, afterwards
  Bishop of Peterborough, a relation of my father.&mdash;S.&nbsp;E. De M.</p>

  <p>He was born in 1757 and died in 1839. On the trial of Frend he
  publicly protested against testifying against a personal confidant, and
  was excused. He was one of the first of the English clergy to study
  modern higher criticism of the Bible, and amid much opposition he wrote
  numerous works on the subject. He was professor of theology at Cambridge
  (1707), Bishop of Llandaff (1816), and Bishop of Peterborough.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_450" href="#NtA_450">[450]</a> George Butler (1774-1853),
  Headmaster of Harrow (1805-1829), Chancellor of Peterborough (1836), and
  Dean of Peterborough (1842).</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_451" href="#NtA_451">[451]</a> James Tate (1771-1843),
  Headmaster of Richmond School (1796-1833) and Canon of St. Paul's
  Cathedral (1833). He left several works on the classics.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_452" href="#NtA_452">[452]</a> Francis Place (1771-1854),
  at first a journeyman breeches maker, and later a master tailor. He was a
  hundred years ahead of his time as a strike leader, but was not so
  successful as an agitator as he was as a tailor, since his shop in
  Charing Cross made him wealthy. He was a well-known radical, and it was
  largely due to his efforts that the law against the combinations of
  workmen was repealed in 1824. His chief work was <i>The Principles of
  Population</i> (1822).</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_453" href="#NtA_453">[453]</a> Speed (1552-1629) was a
  tailor until Grevil (Greville) made him independent of his trade. He was
  not only an historian of some merit, but a skilful cartographer. His maps
  of the counties were collected in the <i>Theatre of the Empire of Great
  Britaine</i>, 1611. About this same time he also published <i>Genealogies
  recorded in Sacred Scripture</i>, a work that had passed through
  thirty-two editions by 1640.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_454" href="#NtA_454">[454]</a> <i>The history of Great
  Britaine under the conquests of ye Romans, Saxons, Danes, and

  fourth in 1650.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_455" href="#NtA_455">[455]</a> William Nicolson
  (1655-1727) became Bishop of Carlisle in 1702, and Bishop of Derry in
  1718. His chief work was the <i>Historical Library</i> (1696-1724), in
  the form of a collection of documents and chronicles. It was reprinted in
  1736 and in 1776.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_456" href="#NtA_456">[456]</a> Sir Fulk Grevil, or Fulke
  Greville (1554-1628), was a favorite of Queen Elizabeth, Chancellor of

  on complex numbers, or possibly one on quaternions, in which direction as
  well as absolute value is involved.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_463" href="#NtA_463">[463]</a> De Morgan quotes from one
  of the Latin editions. Descartes wrote in French, the title of his first

  <p><a name="Nt_464" href="#NtA_464">[464]</a> "I have observed that
  algebra indeed, as it is usually taught, is so restricted by definite
  rules and formulas of calculation, that it seems rather a confused kind

  (1792-1871), whose work on the calculating machine is well known. Maseres
  was, it is true, ninety-two at this time, but Babbage was thirty-one
  instead of twenty-nine. He had already translated Lacroix's <i>Treatise
  on the differential and integral calculus</i> (1816), in collaboration
  with Herschel and Peacock. He was Lucasian professor of mathematics at
  Cambridge from 1828 to 1839.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_471" href="#NtA_471">[471]</a> George Sinclair, probably a
  native of East Lothian, who died in 1696. He was professor of philosophy
  and mathematics at Glasgow, and was one of the first to use the barometer
  in measuring altitudes. The work to which De Morgan refers is his
  <i>Hydrostaticks</i> (1672). He was a firm believer in evil spirits, his
  work on the subject going through four editions: <i>Satan's Invisible
  World Discovered; or, a choice collection of modern relations, proving
  evidently against the Saducees and Athiests of this present age, that
  there are Devils, Spirits, Witches, and Apparitions</i>, Edinburgh,

  <p><a name="Nt_472" href="#NtA_472">[472]</a> This was probably William

  <p><a name="Nt_475" href="#NtA_475">[475]</a> His daughter, Mrs. De
  Morgan, says in her <i>Memoir</i> of her husband: "My father had been
  second wrangler in a year in which the two highest were close together,
  and was, as his son-in-law afterwards described him, an exceedingly clear
  thinker. It is possible, as Mr. De Morgan said, that this mental
  clearness and directness may have caused his mathematical heresy, the
  rejection of the use of negative quantities in algebraical operations;
  and it is probable that he thus deprived himself of an instrument of
  work, the use of which might have led him to greater eminence in the
  higher branches." <i>Memoir of Augustus De Morgan</i>, London, 1882, p.

  sciences. His <i>Elémens de géométrie</i> appeared in 1741. Meantime he
  had taken part in the measurement of a degree in Lapland (1736-1737). His
  <i>Traité de la figure de la terre</i> was published in 1741. The Academy
  of St. Petersburg awarded him a prize for his <i>Théorie de la lune</i>
  (1750). His various works on comets are well known, particularly his
  <i>Théorie du mouvement des comètes</i> (1760) in which he applied the
  "problem of three bodies" to Halley's comet as retarded by Jupiter and
  Saturn.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_480" href="#NtA_480">[480]</a> Joseph Privat, Abbé de
  Molières (1677-1742), was a priest of the Congregation of the Oratorium.
  In 1723 he became a professor in the Collège de France. He was well known
  as an astronomer and a mathematician, and wrote in defense of Descartes's
  theory of vortices (1728, 1729). He also contributed to the methods of
  finding prime numbers (1705).</p>

  his <i>Provincial Letters</i>. Among his works are the following:
  <i>Essai pour les coniques</i> (1640); <i>Recit de la grande expérience
  de l'équilibre des liqueurs</i> (1648), describing his experiment in
  finding altitudes by barometric readings; <i>Histoire de la roulette</i>

  proposition called Pascal's should see the light."</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_487" href="#NtA_487">[487]</a> The story is that his
  father, Etienne Pascal, did not wish him to study geometry until he was
  thoroughly grounded in Latin and Greek. Having heard the nature of the
  subject, however, he began at the age of twelve to construct figures by
  himself, drawing them on the floor with a piece of charcoal. When his
  father discovered what he was doing he was attempting to demonstrate that
  the sum of the angles of a triangle equals two right angles. The story is
  given by his sister, Mme. Perier.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_488" href="#NtA_488">[488]</a> Sir John Wilson (1741-1793)
  was knighted in 1786 and became Commissioner of the Great Seal in 1792.
  He was a lawyer and jurist of recognized merit. He stated his theorem
  without proof, the first demonstration having been given by Lagrange in
  the Memoirs of the Berlin Academy for 1771,&mdash;<i>Demonstration d'un
  théorème nouveau concernant les nombres premiers</i>. Euler also gave a
  proof in his <i>Miscellanea Analytica</i> (1773). Fermat's works should
  be consulted in connection with the early history of this theorem.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_489" href="#NtA_489">[489]</a> He wrote, in 1760, a tract
  in defense of Waring, a point of whose algebra had been assailed by a Dr.
  Powell. Waring wrote another tract of the same date.&mdash;A. De M.</p>

  <p>William Samuel Powell (1717-1775) was at this time a fellow of St.
  John's College, Cambridge. In 1765 he became Vice Chancellor of the
  University. Waring was a Magdalene man, and while candidate for the
  Lucasian professorship he circulated privately his <i>Miscellanea
  Analytica</i>. Powell attacked this in his <i>Observations on the First
  Chapter of a Book called Miscellanea</i> (1760). This attack was probably
  in the interest of another candidate, a man of his own college (St.
  John's), William Ludlam.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_490" href="#NtA_490">[490]</a> William Paley (1743-1805)
  was afterwards a tutor at Christ's College, Cambridge. He never
  contributed anything to mathematics, but his <i>Evidences of
  Christianity</i> (1794) was long considered somewhat of a classic. He
  also wrote <i>Principles of Morality and Politics</i> (1785), and
  <i>Natural Theology</i> (1802).</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_491" href="#NtA_491">[491]</a> Edward, first Baron Thurlow
  (1731-1806) is known to Americans because of his strong support of the
  Royal prerogative during the Revolution. He was a favorite of George III,
  and became Lord Chancellor in 1778.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_492" href="#NtA_492">[492]</a> George Wilson Meadley
  (1774-1818) published his <i>Memoirs of ... Paley</i> in 1809. He also
  published <i>Memoirs of Algernon Sidney</i> in 1813. He was a merchant
  and banker, and had traveled extensively in Europe and the East. He was a
  convert to unitarianism, to which sect Paley had a strong leaning.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_493" href="#NtA_493">[493]</a> Watson (1737-1816) was a
  strange kind of man for a bishopric. He was professor of chemistry at
  Cambridge (1764) at the age of twenty-seven. It was his experiments that
  led to the invention of the black-bulb thermometer. He is said to have
  saved the government £100,000 a year by his advice on the manufacture of
  gunpowder. Even after he became professor of divinity at Cambridge (1771)
  he published four volumes of <i>Chemical Essays</i> (vol. I, 1781). He
  became Bishop of Llandaff in 1782.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_494" href="#NtA_494">[494]</a> James Adair (died in 1798)
  was counsel for the defense in the trial of the publishers of the
  <i>Letters of Junius</i> (1771). As King's Serjeant he assisted in
  prosecuting Hardy and Horne Tooke.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_495" href="#NtA_495">[495]</a> Morgan (1750-1833) was
  actuary of the Equitable Assurance Society of London (1774-1830), and it
  was to his great abilities that the success of that company was due at a
  time when other corporations of similar kind were meeting with disaster.
  The Royal Society awarded him a medal (1783) for a paper on
  <i>Probability of Survivorship</i>. He wrote several important works on
  insurance and finance.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_496" href="#NtA_496">[496]</a> Dr. Price (1723-1791) was a
  non-conformist minister and a writer on ethics, economics, politics, and
  insurance. He was a defender of the American Revolution and a personal
  friend of Franklin. In 1778 Congress invited him to America to assist in
  the financial administration of the new republic, but he declined. His
  famous sermon on the French Revolution is said to have inspired Burke's
  <i>Reflections on the Revolution in France</i>.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_497" href="#NtA_497">[497]</a> Elizabeth Gurney
  (1780-1845), a Quaker, who married Joseph Fry (1800), a London merchant.
  She was the prime mover in the Association for the Improvement of the
  Female Prisoners in Newgate, founded in 1817. Her influence in prison
  reform extended throughout Europe, and she visited the prisons of many
  countries in her efforts to improve the conditions of penal servitude.
  The friendship of Mrs. Fry with the De Morgans began in 1837. Her scheme
  for a female benefit society proved worthless from the actuarial
  standpoint, and would have been disastrous to all concerned if it had
  been carried out, and it was therefore fortunate that De Morgan was
  consulted in time. Mrs. De Morgan speaks of the consultation in these
  words: "My husband, who was very sensitive on such points, was charmed
  with Mrs. Fry's voice and manner as much as by the simple
  self-forgetfulness with which she entered into this business; her own
  very uncomfortable share of it not being felt as an element in the
  question, as long as she could be useful in promoting good or preventing
  mischief. I can see her now as she came into our room, took off her
  little round Quaker cap, and laying it down, went at once into the
  matter. 'I have followed thy advice, and I think nothing further can be
  done in this case; but all harm is prevented.' In the following year I
  had an opportunity of seeing the effect of her most musical tones. I
  visited her at Stratford, taking my little baby and nurse with me, to
  consult her on some articles on prison discipline, which I had written
  for a periodical. The baby&mdash;three months old&mdash;was restless, and
  the nurse could not quiet her, neither could I entirely, until Mrs. Fry
  began to read something connected with the subject of my visit, when the
  infant, fixing her large eyes on the reader, lay listening till she fell
  asleep." <i>Memoirs</i>, p. 91.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_498" href="#NtA_498">[498]</a> Mrs. Fry certainly believed
  that the writer was the old actuary of the Equitable, when she first
  consulted him upon the benevolent Assurance project; but we were
  introduced to her by our old and dear friend Lady Noel Byron, by whom she
  had been long known and venerated, and who referred her to Mr. De Morgan
  for advice. An unusual degree of confidence in, and appreciation of each
  other, arose on their first meeting between the two, who had so much that
  was externally different, and so much that was essentially alike, in
  their natures.&mdash;S.&nbsp;E. De M.</p>

  <p>Anne Isabella Milbanke (1792-1860) married Lord Byron in 1815, when
  both took the additional name of Noel, her mother's name. They were
  separated in 1816.</p>

  <i>Nouvelle théorie des parallèles, avec un appendice contenant la
  manière de perfectionner la théorie des parallèles de A.&nbsp;M. Legendre</i>.
  The author had no standing as a scientist.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_515" href="#NtA_515">[515]</a> Adrien Marie Legendre
  (1752-1833) was one of the great mathematicians of the opening of the
  nineteenth century. His <i>Eléments de géométrie</i> (1794) had great
  influence on the geometry of the United States. His <i>Essai sur la
  théorie des nombres</i> (1798) is one of the classics upon the subject.
  The work to which Kircher refers is the <i>Nouvelle théorie des
  parallèles</i> (1803), in which the attempt is made to avoid using
  Euclid's postulate of parallels, the result being merely the substitution
  of another assumption that was even more unsatisfactory. The best
  presentations of the general theory are W.&nbsp;B. Frankland's <i>Theories of
  Parallelism</i>, Cambridge, 1910, and Engel and Stäckel's <i>Die Theorie
  der Parallellinien von Euclid bis auf Gauss</i>, Leipsic, 1895. Legendre
  published a second work on the theory the year of his death,
  <i>Réflexions sur ... la théorie des parallèles</i> (1833). His other
  works include the <i>Nouvelles méthodes pour la détermination des orbites
  des comètes</i> (1805), in which he uses the method of least squares; the
  <i>Traité des fonctions elliptiques et des intégrales</i> (1827-1832),
  and the <i>Exercises de calcul intégral</i> (1811, 1816, 1817).</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_516" href="#NtA_516">[516]</a> Johann Joseph Ignatz von
  Hoffmann (1777-1866), professor of mathematics at Aschaffenburg,
  published his <i>Theorie der Parallellinien</i> in 1801. He supplemented
  this by his <i>Kritik der Parallelen-Theorie</i> in 1807, and his <i>Das
  eilfte Axiom der Elemente des Euclidis neu bewiesen</i> in 1859. He wrote
  other works on mathematics, but none of his contributions was of any
  importance.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_517" href="#NtA_517">[517]</a> Johann Karl Friedrich Hauff
  (1766-1846) was successively professor of mathematics at Marburg,
  director of the polytechnic school at Augsburg, professor at the
  Gymnasium at Cologne, and professor of mathematics and physics at Ghent.
  The work to which Kircher refers is his memoirs on the Euclidean
  <i>Theorie der Parallelen</i> in Hindenburg's <i>Archiv</i>, vol. III
  (1799), an article of no merit in the general theory.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_518" href="#NtA_518">[518]</a> Wenceslaus Johann Gustav
  Karsten (1732-1787) was professor of logic at Rostock (1758) and Butzow
  (1760), and later became professor of mathematics and physics at Halle.
  His work on parallels is the <i>Versuch einer völlig berichtigten Theorie
  der Parallellinien</i> (1779). He also wrote a work entitled
  <i>Anfangsgründe der mathematischen Wissenschaften</i> (1780), but
  neither of these works was more than mediocre.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_519" href="#NtA_519">[519]</a> Johann Christoph Schwab
  (not Schwal) was born in 1743 and died in 1821. He was professor at the
  Karlsschule at Stuttgart. De Morgan's wish was met, for the catalogues
  give "c. fig. 8," so that it evidently had eight illustrations instead of
  eight volumes. He wrote several other works on the principles of
  geometry, none of any importance.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_520" href="#NtA_520">[520]</a> Gaetano Rossi of Catanzaro.
  This was the libretto writer (1772-1855), and hence the imperfections of
  the work can better be condoned. De Morgan should have given a little
  more of the title: <i>Solusione esatta e regolare ... del ... problema
  della quadratura del circolo</i>. There was a second edition, London,
  1805.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_521" href="#NtA_521">[521]</a> This identifies Rossi, for
  Joséphine Grassini (1773-1850) was a well-known contralto, <i>prima
  donna</i> at Napoleon's court opera.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_522" href="#NtA_522">[522]</a> William Spence (1783-1860)
  was an entomologist and economist of some standing, a fellow of the Royal
  Society, and one of the founders of the Entomological Society of London.
  The work here mentioned was a popular one, the first edition appearing in
  1807, and four editions being justified in a single year. He also wrote
  <i>Agriculture the Source of Britain's Wealth</i> (1808) and
  <i>Objections against the Corn Bill refuted</i> (1815), besides a work in
  four volumes on entomology (1815-1826) in collaboration with William
  Kirby.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_525" href="#NtA_525">[525]</a> George Douglas (or
  Douglass) was a Scotch writer. He got out an edition of the <i>Elements
  of Euclid</i> in 1776, with an appendix on trigonometry and a set of
  tables. His work on <i>Mathematical Tables</i> appeared in 1809, and his
  <i>Art of Drawing in Perspective, from mathematical principles</i>, in
  1810.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_527" href="#NtA_527">[527]</a> John Playfair (1748-1848)
  was professor of mathematics (1785) and natural philosophy (1805) at the
  University of Edinburgh. His <i>Elements of Geometry</i> went through
  many editions.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_528" href="#NtA_528">[528]</a> "Tell Apella" was an
  expression current in classical Rome to indicate incredulity and to show
  the contempt in which the Jew was held. Horace says: <i>Credat Judæus
  Apella</i>, "Let Apella the Jew believe it." Our "Tell it to the
  marines," is a similar phrase.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_529" href="#NtA_529">[529]</a> As De Morgan says two lines
  later, "No mistake is more common than the natural one of imagining that
  the"&mdash;University of Virginia is at Richmond. The fact is that it is
  not there, and that it did not exist in 1810. It was not chartered until
  1819, and was not opened until 1825, and then at Charlottesville. The act
  establishing the Central College, from which the University of Virginia
  developed, was passed in 1816. The Jean Wood to whom De Morgan refers was
  one John Wood who was born about 1775 in Scotland and who emigrated to
  the United States in 1800. He published a <i>History of the
  Administration of J. Adams</i> (New York, 1802) that was suppressed by
  Aaron Burr. This act called forth two works, a <i>Narrative of the
  Suppression, by Col. Burr, of the 'History of the Administration of John
  Adams'</i> (1802), in which Wood was sustained; and the <i>Antidote to
  John Wood's Poison</i> (1802), in which he was attacked. The work
  referred to in the "printed circular" may have been the <i>New theory of
  the diurnal rotation of the earth</i> (Richmond, Va., 1809). Wood spent
  the last years of his life in Richmond, Va., making county maps. He died
  there in 1822. A careful search through works relating to the University
  of Virginia fails to show that Wood had any connection with it.</p>

  brewer, who died in 1781. She then married Gabriel Piozzi (1784), an
  Italian musician. Her <i>Anecdotes of the late Samuel Johnson</i> (1786)
  and <i>Letters to and from Samuel Johnson</i> (1788) are well known. She
  also wrote numerous essays and poems.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_533" href="#NtA_533">[533]</a> Samuel Pike (c. 1717-1773)
  was an independent minister, with a chapel in London and a theological
  school in his house. He later became a disciple of Robert Sandeman and
  left the Independents for the Sandemanian church (1765). The
  <i>Philosophia Sacra</i> was first published at London in 1753. De Morgan
  here cites the second edition.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_534" href="#NtA_534">[534]</a> Pike had been dead over
  forty years when Kittle published this second edition. Kittle had already
  published a couple of works: <i>King Solomon's portraiture of Old Age</i>
  (Edinburgh, 1813), and <i>Critical and Practical Lectures on the
  Apocalyptical Epistles to the Seven Churches of Asia Minor</i> (London,
  1814).</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_536" href="#NtA_536">[536]</a> William Stukely (1687-1765)
  was a fellow of the Royal Society and of the College of Physicians and
  Surgeons. He afterwards (1729) entered the Church. He was prominent as an
  antiquary, especially in the study of the Roman and Druidic remains of
  Great Britain. He was the author of numerous works, chiefly on
  paleography.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_537" href="#NtA_537">[537]</a> William Jones (1726-1800),
  who should not be confused with his namesake who is mentioned in note <a
  href="#Nt_281">281</a> on page <a href="#page135">135</a>. He was a
  lifelong friend of Bishop Horne, and his vicarage at Nayland was a
  meeting place of an influential group of High Churchmen. Besides the
  <i>Physiological Disquisitions</i> (1781) he wrote <i>The Catholic
  Doctrine of the Trinity</i> (1756) and <i>The Grand Analogy</i>
  (1793).</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_538" href="#NtA_538">[538]</a> Robert Spearman (1703-1761)
  was a pupil of John Hutchinson, and not only edited his works but wrote
  his life. He wrote a work against the Newtonian physics, entitled <i>An
  Enquiry after Philosophy and Theology</i> (Edinburgh, 1755), besides the
  <i>Letters to a Friend concerning the Septuagint Translation</i>
  (Edinburgh, 1759) to which De Morgan refers.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_539" href="#NtA_539">[539]</a> A writer of no importance,

  <p><a name="Nt_540" href="#NtA_540">[540]</a> Alexander Catcott
  (1725-1779), a theologian and geologist, wrote not only a work on the
  creation (1756) but a <i>Treatise on the Deluge</i> (1761, with a second
  edition in 1768). Sir Charles Lyell considered the latter work a valuable
  contribution to geology.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_541" href="#NtA_541">[541]</a> James Robertson
  (1714-1795), professor of Hebrew at the University of Edinburgh. Probably
  De Morgan refers to his <i>Grammatica Linguae Hebrææ</i> (Edinburgh,
  1758; with a second edition in 1783). He also wrote <i>Clavis
  Pentateuchi</i> (1770).</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_542" href="#NtA_542">[542]</a> Benjamin Holloway (c.
  1691-1759), a geologist and theologian. He translated Woodward's
  <i>Naturalis Historia Telluris</i>, and was introduced by Woodward to
  Hutchinson. The work referred to by De Morgan appeared at Oxford in two
  volumes in 1754.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_543" href="#NtA_543">[543]</a> His work was <i>The
  Christian plan exhibited in the interpretation of Elohim: with

  <p><a name="Nt_544" href="#NtA_544">[544]</a> Duncan Forbes (1685-1747)

  appeared at London in 1860.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_547" href="#NtA_547">[547]</a> Thomas Sadler (1822-1891)
  took his Ph.D. at Erlangen in 1844, and became a Unitarian minister at

  <i>Gloria Patri</i> (1859), he edited Crabb Robinson's Diaries.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_548" href="#NtA_548">[548]</a> This was his <i>Virgil's

  He was privy councilor to Charles I, and was Lord Deputy of Ireland. On
  account of his repressive measures to uphold the absolute power of the
  king he was impeached by the Long Parliament and was executed for
  treason. The essence of his defence is in the sentence quoted by De
  Morgan, to which Pym replied that taken as a whole, the acts tended to
  show an intention to change the government, and this was in itself
  treason.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_566" href="#NtA_566">[566]</a> Richard Whately (1787-1863)
  was, as a child, a calculating prodigy (see note <a
  href="#Nt_132">132</a>, page <a href="#page86">86</a>), but lost the
  power as is usually the case with well-balanced minds. He was a fellow of
  Oriel College, Oxford, and in 1825 became principal of St. Alban Hall. He
  was a friend of Newman, Keble, and others who were interested in the
  religious questions of the day. He became archbishop of Dublin in 1831.
  He was for a long time known to students through his <i>Logic</i> (1826)
  and <i>Rhetoric</i> (1828).</p>

  (1663-1712), student at Christ Church, Oxford, and celebrated as a wit
  and scholar. His <i>Dialogues of the Dead</i> (1699) is a satirical
  attack on Bentley.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_568" href="#NtA_568">[568]</a> Thomas Ebrington
  (1760-1835) was a fellow of Trinity College, Dublin, and taught divinity,
  mathematics, and natural philosophy there. He became provost of the
  college in 1811, bishop of Limerick in 1820, and bishop of Leighlin and
  Ferns in 1822. His edition of Euclid was reprinted a dozen times. The
  <i>Reply to John Search's Considerations on the Law of Libel</i> appeared
  at Dublin in 1834.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_569" href="#NtA_569">[569]</a> Joseph Blanco White
  (1775-1841) was the son of an Irishman living in Spain. He was born at
  Seville and studied for orders there, being ordained priest in 1800. He
  lost his faith in the Roman Catholic Church, and gave up the ministry,
  escaping to England at the time of the French invasion. At London he
  edited <i>Español</i>, a patriotic journal extensively circulated in
  Spain, and for this service he was pensioned after the expulsion of the
  French. He then studied at Oriel College, Oxford, and became intimate
  with men like Whately, Newman, and Keble. In 1835 he became a Unitarian.
  Among his theological writings is his <i>Evidences against
  Catholicism</i> (1825). The "rejoinder" to which De Morgan refers
  consisted of two letters: <i>The law of anti-religious Libel
  reconsidered</i> (Dublin, 1834) and <i>An Answer to some Friendly Remarks
  on "The Law of Anti-Religious Libel Reconsidered"</i> (Dublin, 1834).</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_570" href="#NtA_570">[570]</a> The work was translated
  from the French.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_571" href="#NtA_571">[571]</a> J. Hoëné Wronski
  (1778-1853) served, while yet a mere boy, as an artillery officer in
  Kosciusko's army (1791-1794). He was imprisoned after the battle of
  Maciejowice. He afterwards lived in Germany, and (after 1810) in Paris.
  For the bibliography of his works see S. Dickstein's article in the
  <i>Bibliotheca Mathematica</i>, vol. VI (2), page 48.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_574" href="#NtA_574">[574]</a> Thomas Young (1773-1829),
  physician and physicist, sometimes called the founder of physiological
  optics. He seems to have initiated the theory of color blindness that was
  later developed by Helmholtz. The attack referred to was because of his
  connection with the Board of Longitude, he having been made (1818)
  superintendent of the Nautical Almanac and secretary of the Board. He
  opposed introducing into the Nautical Almanac anything not immediately
  useful to navigation, and this antagonized many scientists.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_575" href="#NtA_575">[575]</a> Isaac Milner (1750-1820)
  was professor of natural philosophy at Cambridge (1783) and later became,
  as De Morgan states, president of Queens' College (1788). In 1791 he
  became dean of Carlisle, and in 1798 Lucasian professor of mathematics.
  His chief interest was in chemistry and physics, but he contributed
  nothing of importance to these sciences or to mathematics.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_576" href="#NtA_576">[576]</a> Thomas Perronet Thompson
  (1783-1869), fellow of Queens' College, Cambridge, saw service in Spain
  and India, but after 1822 lived in England. He became major general in
  1854, and general in 1868. Besides some works on economics and politics
  he wrote a <i>Geometry without Axioms</i> (1830) that De Morgan includes
  later on in his <i>Budget</i>. In it Thompson endeavored to prove the
  parallel postulate.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_580" href="#NtA_580">[580]</a> William Law (1686-1761) was
  a clergyman, a fellow of Emanuel College, Cambridge, and in later life a
  convert to Behmen's philosophy. He was so free in his charities that the
  village in which he lived became so infested by beggars that he was urged
  by the citizens to leave. He wrote <i>A serious call to a devout and holy
  life</i> (1728).</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_581" href="#NtA_581">[581]</a> He was a curate at
  Cheshunt, and wrote the <i>Spiritual voice to the Christian Church and to
  the Jews</i> (London, 1760), <i>A second warning to the world by the
  Spirit of Prophecy</i> (London, 1760), and <i>Signs of the Times; or a
  Voice to Babylon</i> (London, 1773).</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_582" href="#NtA_582">[582]</a> His real name was Thomas
  Vaughan (1622-1666). He was a fellow of Jesus College, Oxford, taking
  orders, but was deprived of his living on account of drunkenness. He
  became a mystic philosopher and gave attention to alchemy. His works had
  a large circulation, particularly on the continent. He wrote <i>Magia
  Adamica</i> (London, 1650), <i>Euphrates; or the Waters of the East</i>
  (London, 1655), and <i>The Chymist's key to shut, and to open; or the
  True Doctrine of Corruption and Generation</i> (London, 1657).</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_583" href="#NtA_583">[583]</a> Emanuel Swedenborg, or
  Svedberg (1688-1772) the mystic. It is not commonly known to
  mathematicians that he was one of their guild, but he wrote on both
  mathematics and chemistry. Among his works are the <i>Regelkonst eller
  algebra</i> (Upsala, 1718) and the <i>Methodus nova inveniendi
  longitudines locorum, terra marique, ope lunae</i> (Amsterdam, 1721,
  1727, and 1766). After 1747 he devoted his attention to mystic
  philosophy.</p>

  who taught mathematics and physics at New College, Manchester (1793-1799)
  and was the first to state the law of the expansion of gases known by his
  name and that of Gay-Lussac. His <i>New system of Chemical Philosophy</i>
  (Vol. I, pt. i, 1808; pt. ii, 1810; vol. II, 1827) sets forth his atomic
  theory.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_587" href="#NtA_587">[587]</a> Howison was a poet and
  philosopher. He lived in Edinburgh and was a friend of Sir Walter Scott.
  This work appeared in 1822.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_588" href="#NtA_588">[588]</a> He was a shoemaker, born
  about 1765 at Haddiscoe, and his "astro-historical" lectures at Norwich
  attracted a good deal of attention at one time. He traced all geologic
  changes to differences in the inclination of the earth's axis to the
  plane of its orbit. Of the works mentioned by De Morgan the first
  appeared at Norwich in 1822-1823, and there was a second edition in 1824.
  The second appeared in 1824-1825. The fourth was <i>Urania's Key to the
  Revelation; or the analyzation of the writings of the Jews...</i>, and
  was first published at Norwich in 1823, there being a second edition at
  London in 1833. His books were evidently not a financial success, for
  Mackey died in an almshouse at Norwich.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_589" href="#NtA_589">[589]</a> Godfrey Higgins
  (1773-1833), the archeologist, was interested in the history of religious
  beliefs and in practical sociology. He wrote <i>Horae Sabbaticae</i>
  (1826), <i>The Celtic Druids</i> (1827 and 1829), and <i>Anacalypsis, an
  attempt to draw aside the veil of the Saitic Isis; or an Inquiry into the
  Origin of Languages, Nations, and Religions</i> (posthumously published,
  1836), and other works. See also page <a href="#page274">274</a>,
  <i>infra</i>.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_590" href="#NtA_590">[590]</a> The work also appeared in
  French. Wirgman wrote, or at least began, two other works:
  <i>Divarication of the New Testament into Doctrine and History; part I,
  The Four Gospels</i> (London, 1830), and <i>Mental Philosophy; part I,
  Grammar of the five senses; being the first step to infant education</i>
  (London, 1838).</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_591" href="#NtA_591">[591]</a> He was born at Shandrum,
  County Limerick, and supported himself by teaching writing and
  arithmetic. He died in an almshouse at Cork.</p>

  the Jesuit who became famous for his controversy with Galileo over the
  theory of comets. Galileo ridiculed him in <i>Il Saggiatore</i>, although
  according to the modern view Grassi was the more nearly right. It is said
  that the latter's resentment led to the persecution of Galileo.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_594" href="#NtA_594">[594]</a> De Morgan might have found
  much else for his satire in the letters of Walsh. He sought, in his
  <i>Theory of Partial Functions</i>, to substitute "partial equations" for
  the differential calculus. In his diary there is an entry: "Discovered
  the general solution of numerical equations of the fifth degree at 114
  Evergreen Street, at the Cross of Evergreen, Cork, at nine o'clock in the
  forenoon of July 7th, 1844; exactly twenty-two years after the invention
  of the Geometry of Partial Equations, and the expulsion of the
  differential calculus from Mathematical Science."</p>

  Liverpool accountant. De Morgan gives this correct spelling on page <a
  href="#page278">278</a>. He died after 1849. His <i>Inverted Scheme of
  Copernicus</i> appeared in Liverpool in 1822.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_597" href="#NtA_597">[597]</a> Robert Taylor (1784-1844)
  had many more ups and downs than De Morgan mentions. He was a priest of
  the Church of England, but resigned his parish in 1818 after preaching
  against Christianity. He soon recanted and took another parish, but was
  dismissed by the Bishop almost immediately on the ground of heresy. As
  stated in the text, he was convicted of blasphemy in 1827 and was
  sentenced to a year's imprisonment, and again for two years on the same
  charge in 1831. He then married a woman who was rich in money and in
  years, and was thereupon sued for breach of promise by another woman. To
  escape paying the judgment that was rendered against him he fled to Tours
  where he took up surgery.</p>

  parodies (see note <a href="#Nt_250">250</a>, page <a
  href="#page124">124</a>) after they had been suppressed, and an edition
  of Thomas Paine (1818). He was repeatedly imprisoned, serving nine years
  in all. His continued conflict with the authorities proved a good
  advertisement for his bookshop.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_601" href="#NtA_601">[601]</a> Wilhelm Ludwig Christmann
  (1780-1835) was a protestant clergyman and teacher of mathematics. For a
  while he taught under Pestalozzi. Disappointed in his ambition to be
  professor of mathematics at Tubingen, he became a confirmed misanthrope
  and is said never to have left his house during the last ten years of his
  life. He wrote several works: <i>Ein Wort über Pestalozzi und
  Pestalozzismus</i> (1812); <i>Ars cossae promota</i> (1814);
  <i>Philosophia cossica</i> (1815); <i>Aetas argentea cossae</i> (1819);
  <i>Ueber Tradition und Schrift, Logos und Kabbala</i> (1829), besides the
  one mentioned above. The word <i>coss</i> in the above titles was a
  German name for algebra, from the Italian <i>cosa</i> (thing), the name
  for the unknown quantity. It appears in English in the early name for
  algebra, "the cossic art."</p>

  was made professor of the humanities at Dijon. He served in the army, and
  then became professor of mathematics at Dijon. He continued in his chair
  until the restoration of the Bourbons, and then fled to Louvain. It was
  here that he developed the method with which his name is usually
  connected. He wrote a <i>Mathématiques</i> in 1827, which went through
  four editions. The <i>Epitomé</i> is by his son, Fortuné.</p>

  may be to his <i>Resolution des problèmes qui regardent le jeu du franc

  spending twenty of his best years in Germany, he is commonly looked upon
  as the great leader of French mathematicians. The last twenty-seven years
  of his life were spent in Paris, and his remarkable productivity
  continued to the time of his death. His genius in the theory of numbers
  was probably never excelled except by Fermat. He received very high
  honors at the hands of Napoleon and was on the first staff of the Ecole

  in 1831 because of his advocacy of reform. This must have been the time
  when Goulburn defeated him. He was Foreign Secretary (1827) and Secretary
  of State for Foreign Affairs (1830-1841, and 1846-1851). It is said of
  him that he "created Belgium, saved Portugal and Spain from absolutism,
  rescued Turkey from Russia and the highway to India from France." He was
  Prime Minister almost continuously from 1855 to 1865, a period covering
  the Indian Mutiny and the American Civil War.</p>

  an astronomical instrument of French make through the custom house by
  having Troughton's (See note <a href="#Nt_332">332</a>, page <a

  mentioned he was Bishop of Ripon (1836-1856), and before that was
  headmaster of Harrow (1829-1836).</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_698" href="#NtA_698">[698]</a> Thomson (1819-1890) was
  scholar and fellow of Queen's College, Oxford. He became chaplain to the
  Queen in 1859.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_699" href="#NtA_699">[699]</a> This is worthy of the
  statistical psychologists of the present day.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_700" href="#NtA_700">[700]</a> The famous Moon Hoax was
  written by Richard Adams Locke, who was born in New York in 1800 and died
  in Staten Island in 1871. He was at one time editor of the <i>Sun</i>,
  and the Hoax appeared in that journal in 1835. It was reprinted in London
  (1836) and Germany, and was accepted seriously by most readers. It was
  published in book form in New York in 1852 under the title <i>The Moon
  Hoax</i>. Locke also wrote another hoax, the <i>Lost Manuscript of Mungo
  Park</i>, but it attracted relatively little attention.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_701" href="#NtA_701">[701]</a> It is true that
  Jean-Nicolas Nicollet (1756-1843) was at that time in the United States,
  but there does not seem to be any very tangible evidence to connect him
  with the story. He was secretary and librarian of the Paris observatory
  (1817), member of the Bureau of Longitudes (1822), and teacher of
  mathematics in the Lycée Louis-le-Grand. Having lost his money through
  speculations he left France for the United States in 1831 and became
  connected with the government survey of the Mississippi Valley.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_702" href="#NtA_702">[702]</a> This was Alexis Bouvard
  (1767-1843), who made most of the computations for Laplace's <i>Mécanique
  céleste</i> (1793). He discovered eight new comets and calculated their
  orbits. In his tables of Uranus (1821) he attributed certain
  perturbations to the presence of an undiscovered planet, but unlike
  Leverrier and Adams he did not follow up this clue and thus discover
  Neptune.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_703" href="#NtA_703">[703]</a> Patrick Murphy (1782-1847)
  awoke to find himself famous because of his natural guess that there
  would be very cold weather on January 20, although that is generally the
  season of lowest temperature. It turned out that his forecasts were
  partly right on 168 days and very wrong on 197 days.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_704" href="#NtA_704">[704]</a> He seems to have written
  nothing else. If one wishes to enter into the subject of the mathematics
  of the Great Pyramid there is an extensive literature awaiting him.
  Richard William Howard Vyse (1784-1853) published in 1840 his
  <i>Operations carried on at the Pyramids of Gizeh in 1837</i>, and in
  this he made a beginning of a scientific metrical study of the subject.
  Charles Piazzi Smyth (1819-1900), astronomer Royal for Scotland
  (1845-1888) was much carried away with the number mysticism of the Great
  Pyramid, so much so that he published in 1864 a work entitled <i>Our
  Inheritance in the Great Pyramid</i>, in which his vagaries were set
  forth. Although he was then a Fellow of the Royal Society (1857), his
  work was so ill received that when he offered a paper on the subject it
  was rejected (1874) and he resigned in consequence of this action. The
  latest and perhaps the most scholarly of all investigators of the subject
  is William Matthew Flinders Petrie (born in 1853), Edwards professor of
  Egyptology at University College, London, whose <i>Pyramids and Temples
  of Gizeh</i> (1883) and subsequent works are justly esteemed as
  authorities.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_705" href="#NtA_705">[705]</a> As De Morgan subsequently
  found, this name reversed becomes Oliver B...e, for Oliver Byrne, one of
  the odd characters among the minor mathematical writers of the middle of
  the last century. One of his most curious works is <i>The first six Books
  of the Elements of Euclid; in which coloured diagrams and symbols are
  used instead of letters</i> (1847). There is some merit in speaking of
  the red triangle instead of the triangle ABC, but not enough to give the
  method any standing. His <i>Dual Arithmetic</i> (1863-1867) was also a
  curious work.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_706" href="#NtA_706">[706]</a> Brenan also wrote on
  English composition (1829), a work that went through fourteen editions by
  1865; a work entitled <i>The Foreigner's English Conjugator</i> (1831),
  and a work on the national debt.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_709" href="#NtA_709">[709]</a> Sir William Rowan Hamilton
  (1805-1865), the discoverer of quaternions (1852), was an infant prodigy,
  competing with Zerah Colburn as a child. He was a linguist of remarkable
  powers, being able, at thirteen years of age, to boast that he knew as
  many languages as he had lived years. When only sixteen he found an error
  in Laplace's <i>Mécanique céleste</i>. When only twenty-two he was
  appointed Andrews professor of astronomy, and he soon after became
  Astronomer Royal of Ireland. He was knighted in 1835. His earlier work
  was on optics, his <i>Theory of Systems of Rays</i> appearing in 1823. In
  1827 he published a paper on the principle of <i>Varying Action</i>. He
  also wrote on dynamics.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_710" href="#NtA_710">[710]</a> "Let him not leave the

  <p><a name="Nt_711" href="#NtA_711">[711]</a> Probably De Morgan is
  referring to Johann Bernoulli III (1744-1807), who edited Lambert's
  <i>Logische und philosophische Abhandlungen</i>, Berlin, 1782. He was
  astronomer of the Academy of Sciences at Berlin.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_712" href="#NtA_712">[712]</a> Jacob Bernoulli (1654-1705)
  was one of the two brothers who founded the famous Bernoulli family of
  mathematicians, the other being Johann I. His <i>Ars conjectandi</i>
  (1713), published posthumously, was the first distinct treatise on
  probabilities.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_713" href="#NtA_713">[713]</a> Johann Heinrich Lambert

  <p><a name="Nt_720" href="#NtA_720">[720]</a> A very truculently unjust
  assertion: for Sir W. was as great a setter up of some as he was a puller
  down of others. His writings are a congeries of praises and blames, both
  <i>cruel smart</i>, as they say in the States. But the combined
  instigation of prose, rhyme, and retort would send Aristides himself to
  Tartarus, if it were not pretty certain that Minos would grant a <i>stet
  processus</i> under the circumstances. The first two verses are
  exaggerations standing on a basis of truth. The fourth verse is quite
  true: Sir W.&nbsp;H. was an Edinburgh Aristotle, with the difference of
  ancient and modern Athens well marked, especially the <i>perfervidum

  <p>Louis Benjamin Franc&oelig;ur (1773-1849), after holding positions in
  the Ecole polytechnique (1804) and the Lycée Charlemagne (1805), became
  professor of higher algebra in the University of Paris (1809). His
  <i>Cours complet des mathématiques pures</i> was well received, and he

  <p><a name="Nt_760" href="#NtA_760">[760]</a> Albertus Pighius, or Albert
  Pigghe, was born at Kempen c. 1490 and died at Utrecht in 1542. He was a
  mathematician and a firm defender of the faith, asserting the supremacy
  of the Pope and attacking both Luther and Calvin. He spent some time in
  Rome. His greatest work was his <i>Hierarchiæ ecclesiasticæ assertio</i>
  (1538).</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_761" href="#NtA_761">[761]</a> This was A. F. Vogel. The
  work was his translation from the German edition which appeared at
  Leipsic the same year, <i>Entdeckung einer numerischen General-Auflösung

  und transcendenten Form</i>.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_762" href="#NtA_762">[762]</a> The latest edition of
  Burnside and Panton's <i>Theory of Equations</i> has this brief summary
  of the present status of the problem: "Demonstrations have been given by
  Abel and Wantzel (see Serret's <i>Cours d'Algèbre Supérieure</i>, Art.
  516) of the impossibility of resolving algebraically equations
  unrestricted in form, of a degree higher than the fourth. A
  transcendental solution, however, of the quintic has been given by M.
  Hermite, in a form involving elliptic integrals."</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_763" href="#NtA_763">[763]</a> There was a second edition

  <p><a name="Nt_766" href="#NtA_766">[766]</a> Abraham de Moivre
  (1667-1754), French refugee in London, poor, studying under difficulties,
  was a man with tastes in some respects like those of De Morgan. For one
  thing, he was a lover of books, and he had a good deal of interest in the
  theory of probabilities to which De Morgan also gave much thought. His
  introduction of imaginary quantities into trigonometry was an event of
  importance in the history of mathematics, and the theorem that bears his
  name, (cos <span class="grk">&phi;</span> + <i>i</i> sin <span
  class="grk">&phi;</span>)<sup><i>n</i></sup> = cos <i>n</i><span

  founded on the works of Hipparchus.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_776" href="#NtA_776">[776]</a> Dr. Whewell, when I
  communicated this song to him, started the opinion, which I had before
  him, that this was a very good idea, of which too little was
  made.&mdash;A. De M.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_779" href="#NtA_779">[779]</a> He lost it in a duel, with
  Manderupius Pasbergius. A contemporary, T.&nbsp;B. Laurus, insinuates that
  they fought to settle which was the best mathematician! This seems odd,
  but it must be remembered they fought in the dark, "<i>in tenebris
  densis</i>"; and it is a nice problem to shave off a nose in the dark,
  without any other harm.&mdash;A. De M.</p>

  <p>Was this T. B. Laurus Joannes Baptista Laurus or Giovanni Battista
  Lauro (1581-1621), the poet and writer?</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_784" href="#NtA_784">[784]</a> As great a lie as ever was
  told: but in 1800 a compliment to Newton without a fling at Descartes
  would have been held a lopsided structure.&mdash;A. De M.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_785" href="#NtA_785">[785]</a> Jean-le-Rond D'Alembert
  (1717-1783), the foundling who was left on the steps of Jean-le-Rond in
  Paris, and who became one of the greatest mathematical physicists and
  astronomers of his century.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_786" href="#NtA_786">[786]</a> Leonhard Euler (1707-1783),

  <p><a name="Nt_791" href="#NtA_791">[791]</a> The founding of the London
  Mathematical Society is discussed by Mrs. De Morgan in her <i>Memoir</i>
  (p. 281). The idea came from a conversation between her brilliant son,
  George Campbell De Morgan, and his friend Arthur Cowper Ranyard in 1864.
  The meeting of organization was held on Nov. 7, 1864, with Professor De
  Morgan in the chair, and the first regular meeting on January 16,
  1865.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_795" href="#NtA_795">[795]</a> Sir Roderick Impey
  Murchison (1792-1871), the great geologist. He was knighted in 1846 and

  Society and to the geology of Scotland.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_796" href="#NtA_796">[796]</a> Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel
  (1784-1846), the astronomer and physicist. He was professor of astronomy
  at Königsberg.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_797" href="#NtA_797">[797]</a> This was the <i>Reduction

  <p><a name="Nt_800" href="#NtA_800">[800]</a> Franz Friedrich Ernst
  Brünnow (1821-1891) was at that time or shortly before director of the
  observatory at Dusseldorf. He then went to Berlin and thence (1854) to
  Ann Arbor, Michigan. He then went to Dublin and finally became Royal
  Astronomer of Ireland.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_801" href="#NtA_801">[801]</a> Johann Gottfried Galle
  (1812-1910), at that time connected with the Berlin observatory, and

  <p><a name="Nt_805" href="#NtA_805">[805]</a> Robert Grant's (1814-1892)
  <i>History of Physical Astronomy from the Earliest Ages to the Middle of
  the Nineteenth Century</i> appeared in 1852. He was professor of
  astronomy and director of the observatory at Glasgow.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_806" href="#NtA_806">[806]</a> John Debenham was more
  interested in religion than in astronomy. He wrote <i>The Strait Gate;
  or, the true scripture doctrine of salvation clearly explained</i>,
  London, 1843, and <i>Tractatus de magis et Bethlehemæ stella et Christi
  in deserto tentatione</i>, privately printed at London in 1845.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_807" href="#NtA_807">[807]</a> More properly the Sydney
  Smirke reading room, since it was built from his designs.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_808" href="#NtA_808">[808]</a> The Antinomians were
  followers of Johannes Agricola (1494-1566). They believed that Christians
  as such were released from all obligations to the Old Testament. Some
  went so far as to assert that, since all Christians were sanctified, they
  could not lose this sanctity even though they disobeyed God. The sect was
  prominent in England in the seventeenth century, and was transferred to
  New England. Here it suffered a check in the condemnation of Mrs. Ann
  Hutchinson (1636) by the Newton Synod.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_809" href="#NtA_809">[809]</a> Aside from this work and
  his publications on Reeve and Muggleton he wrote nothing. With Joseph
  Frost he published <i>A list</i> <i>of Books and general index to J.
  Reeve and L. Muggleton's works</i> (1846), <i>Divine Songs of the
  Muggletonians</i> (1829), and the work mentioned on page <a
  href="#page396">396</a>. <i>The works of J. Reeve and L. Muggleton</i>
  (1832).</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_810" href="#NtA_810">[810]</a> About 1650 he and his
  cousin John Reeve (1608-1658) began to have visions. As part of their
  creed they taught that astronomy was opposed by the Bible. They asserted
  that the sun moves about the earth, and Reeve figured out that heaven was
  exactly six miles away. Both Muggleton and Reeve were imprisoned for
  their unitarian views. Muggleton wrote a <i>Transcendant Spirituall
  Treatise</i> (1652). I have before me <i>A true Interpretation of All the
  Chief Texts ... of the whole Book of the Revelation of St. John.... By
  Lodowick Muggleton, one of the two last Commissioned Witnesses &amp;
  Prophets of the onely high, immortal, glorious God, Christ Jesus</i>
  (1665), in which the interpretation of the "number of the beast" occupies
  four pages without arriving anywhere.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_811" href="#NtA_811">[811]</a> In 1652 he was, in a
  vision, named as the Lord's "last messenger," with Muggleton as his
  "mouth," and died six years later, probably of nervous tension resulting
  from his divine "illumination." He was the more spiritual of the two.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_812" href="#NtA_812">[812]</a> William Guthrie (1708-1770)
  was a historian and political writer. His <i>History of England</i>
  (1744-1751) was the first attempt to base history on parliamentary
  records. He also wrote a <i>General History of Scotland</i> in 10 volumes
  (1767). The work to which Frost refers is the <i>Geographical,
  Historical, and Commercial Grammar</i> (1770) which contained an
  astronomical part by J. Ferguson. By 1827 it had passed through 24
  editions.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_813" href="#NtA_813">[813]</a> George Fox (1624-1691),
  founder of the Society of Friends; a mystic and a disciple of Boehme. He
  was eight times imprisoned for heresy.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_814" href="#NtA_814">[814]</a> If they were friends they
  were literary antagonists, for Muggleton wrote against Fox <i>The Neck of
  the Quakers Broken</i> (1663), and Fox replied in 1667. Muggleton also
  wrote <i>A Looking Glass for George Fox</i>.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_815" href="#NtA_815">[815]</a> John Conduitt (1688-1737),
  who married (1717) Newton's half niece, Mrs. Katherine Barton. See note

  <p><a name="Nt_816" href="#NtA_816">[816]</a> Probably Peter Mark Roget's
  (1779-1869) <i>Thesaurus of English Words</i> (1852) is not much used at
  present, but it went through 28 editions in his lifetime. Few who use the
  valuable work are aware that Roget was a professor of physiology at the
  Royal Institution (London), that he achieved his title of F. R. S.
  because of his work in perfecting the slide rule, and that he followed
  Sir John Herschel as secretary of the Royal Society.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_820" href="#NtA_820">[820]</a> George Jacob Holyoake
  (1817-1906) entered into a controversial life at an early age. In 1841 he
  was imprisoned for six months for blasphemy. He founded and edited <i>The
  Reasoner</i> (Vols. 1-26, 1846-1861). In his later life he did much to
  promote cooperation among the working class.</p>
